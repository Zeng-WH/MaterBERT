0	Spark plasma sintering (SPS) was employed to synthesize Sr 2 SiO 3.5 N 0.333 :Eu 2+ , Sr 2 SiO 3 N 0.667 :Eu 2+ , and Sr 2 SiO 2 N 1.333 :Eu 2+  for use in white light emitting diodes (LED) lightings. The SPS technique enabled a complete, rapid synthesis of these phosphors with ease, whereas it is difficult to produce nitridosilicate phosphors by any other conventional synthesis methods. The photoluminescent (PL) spectrum of Sr 2 SiO 3.5 N 0.333 :Eu 2+ had two emission peaks, one at 420 and the other at 526 nm. There existed a single peak at 529 nm in the case of Sr 2 SiO 3 N 0.667 :Eu 2+ . The PL spectrum of Sr 2 SiO 2 N 1.333 :Eu 2+  also had two peaks, one at 529 and the other at 600 nm. Even though the exact structure was not identified, it was revealed that the X-ray diffraction pattern of Sr 2 SiO 3.5 N 0.333 :Eu 2+ , Sr 2 SiO 3 N 0.667 :Eu 2+ , and Sr 2 SiO 2 N 1  333:Eu 2+  was consistent with the PL data. The phosphor with the highest nitrogen content, Sr 2 SiO 2 N 1. 333:Eu 2+ , showed a broad emission band spanning almost the entire visible range, which may work best if coupled with either UV or blue LEDs.
0	The addition of a carbosilane skeleton precursor to a plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition process producing porous SiCOH dielectrics (pSiCOH) is shown to affect the carbon content and the pore structure of pSiCOH. Positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS) reveals that added carbosilane reduces pore connectivity. PALS also shows evidence of both smaller ultramicropores ( 0.7 nm) in these materials. The method of N 2  adsorption porosimetry and the alpha-plot analysis provide an understanding of the PALS connectivity results through a correlation of high pore connectivity with a high fraction of porosity as the larger supermicropores. Low pore connectivity correlates with a low fraction of the porosity as supermicropores. A potential figure of merit for pSiCOH is then obtained, which is the amount of the porous volume present as the smallest ultramicropores. This is derived as the difference in porous volumes measured by N 2  adsorption vs toluene adsorption. The addition of a carbosilane precursor to pSiCOH deposition results in pSiCOH with a smaller average pore size and reduced pore connectivity.
0	A study on the preparation of thermally stable phosphor targets based on yttrium aluminium garnet doped with cerium (YAG:Ce) when excited by a high power laser diode is described. The luminous flux, chromaticity and Radial spectral flux of the targets along with their thermal stability have been determined when exposed to laser powers of up to 5000mW. This report presents successful high brightness light sources with adjustable emission properties achieved by utilising thermally stable phosphor targets excited by high power laser diodes.
1	An asymmetric synthesis of the tubulin polymerisation inhibitor (S)-(−)-N-acetylcolchinol is reported based on an intramolecular biaryl oxidative coupling of a 1,3-diarylpropyl acetamide intermediate using phenyliodonium bis(trifluoroacetate) as the final step. Three syntheses of the penultimate 1,3-diarylpropyl acetamide intermediate (S)-(−)-N-[1-[3-(tert-butyldimethylsilyloxy)phenyl)]-3-(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)propyl] acetamide are described which differ in the means by which the stereogenic centre was introduced.
1	The cationic sensitizer 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(N-methylpyridinium-4-yl)porphyrin (TMPyP) forms supramolecular complexes with native, per-methylated, sulfonated and dimethyl-sulfonated cyclodextrins (CDs). Binding interactions were proved by NMR, mass spectra, capillary zone electrophoresis, UV-Vis and fluorescence spectroscopy. The 2D-NMR experiments on native CDs indicate that the interaction of TMPyP with the external CD surface is the dominant binding mode. The high binding affinity of TMPyP towards sulfonated CDs is due to electrostatic interactions. Binding is accompanied by an increase of the TMPyP basicity. Whereas βCD does not affect the lifetime of the TMPyP triplet states, binding with sulfonated CDs causes the protonation of the TMPyP triplet states even in neutral solution. The diprotonated anionic sensitizer 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-sulfonatophenyl)porphyrin (TPPSH22+) forms host–guest complexes with native βCD and γCD, similarly as in its non-protonated state. The positive charge of pyrrole nitrogen atoms does not significantly influence the mode of the interaction. In contrast to TMPyP, the lifetimes of the triplet states of bound TPPSH22+ to native CDs increase.
0	Metal-free transfer hydrogenation of polarized olefins (RR′CCEE′: R, R′ = H or organyl, E, E′ = CN or CO2Me) using amine borane adducts RR′NH–BH3 (R = R′ = H, AB; R = Me, R′ = H, MAB; R = tBu, R′ = H, tBAB; R = R′ = Me, DMAB) as hydrogen donors, were studied by means of in situ NMR spectroscopy. Deuterium kinetic isotope effects and the traced hydroboration intermediate revealed that the double H transfer process occurred regio-specifically in two steps with hydride before proton transfer characteristics. Studies on substituent effects and Hammett correlation indicated that the rate determining step of the HN transfer is in agreement with a concerted transition state. The very reactive intermediate [NH2BH2] generated from AB was trapped by addition of cyclohexene into the reaction mixture forming Cy2BNH2. The final product borazine (BHNH)3 is assumed to be formed by dehydrocoupling of [NH2BH2] or its solvent stabilized derivative [NH2BH2]–(solvent), rather than by dehydrogenation of cyclotriborazane (BH2NH2)3 which is the trimerization product of [NH2BH2].
0	Tautomeric switching is observed in a series of benzimidazole-based anion receptors upon addition of basic anions. An N-methylbenzimidazole based receptor selectively interacts with dihydrogen phosphate over a variety of other putative anionic guests via a combination of donated and accepted hydrogen bonds.
1	In the context of our studies on the applications of 3-aminolactams as conformationally restricted pseudodipeptides, we report here the synthesis of a library of potential dimerisation inhibitors of HIV1-protease. Two of the pseudopeptides were active on the wild type virus (HIV1) at micromolar levels (EC50). Although the peptides showed lower anti-viral activity than previously reported dimerisation inhibitors, our results demonstrate that the piperidone moiety does not prevent cell penetration, and hence that such derivatization is compatible with potential anti-HIV treatment.
1	The present approach for determining the electrophilicity (E) and nucleophilicity (N) of aldehydes includes a kinetic study of KMNO4 oxidation and NaBH4 reduction of aldehydes. A transition state analysis of the KMNO4 promoted aldehyde oxidation reaction has been performed, which shows a very good correlation with experimental results. The validity of the experimental method has been tested using the experimental activation parameters of the two reactions. The utility of the present approach is further demonstrated by the theoretical versus experimental relationship, which provides easy access to E and N values for various aldehydes and offers an at-a-glance assessment of the chemical reactivity of aldehydes in various reactions.
1	A structural polymorphism of nucleic acids, which depends on the concentration of cations and the conditions of hydration, are strongly involved with interactions between DNA and proteins. In this paper, we report that different DNA sequences bound to hyperthermostable TATA-box-binding protein (PhoTBP) at different combinations of temperature and salt concentration in in vitro selection experiments. As a result of the interaction of-these selected DNAs with PhoTBP, characteristic changes in the numbers of water molecules and ions occurred under each condition of the selection experiment. This finding could help us to understand the solvent environment-dependent preference for base sequences in protein–DNA interactions.
0	We report the first synthesis of a photodegradable hyperbranched polyacetal, wherein every repeat unit carries a photo-labile 2-nitrobenzyloxy moiety. The pristine HBP serves as a positive photoresist to create micron-size patterns; furthermore, by changing the terminal groups to dipropargyl acetal, clickable photo-patterned substrates can be generated.
1	The fidelity of acylation regioselectivity in the synthesis of mixed glycosyl diacylglycerols can be accurately measured by quantitative 13C NMR spectroscopy using a 1-13C-labelled fatty acid and a paramagnetic relaxation enhancement agent. Exquisite regioselectivity is achieved using a stepwise acylation/substitution of a glycosyl β-bromohydrin, which is applied to the total synthesis of Streptococcus pneumoniae Glc-DAG-s2.
1	Herein, the unzipping and translocation of DNA duplexes through a sub-2 nm silicon nitride (SiNx) solid-state nanopore have been demonstrated by well-resolved three-level blockades. In order to examine our observations, we applied a simple model which is applicable to the unzipping and translocation processes of DNA duplexes through solid-state nanopores. The generation of these highly recognizable signatures is an important step towards the real applications of solid-state nanopores in complex samples.
1	This article describes a novel assembly technique with highly accurate semi-automatic alignment of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) substrates for microfluidic devices. The technique is realized by specific concave structures, consisting of fringes of PDMS named the “Pliant Zipper”. Microchannels and the Pliant Zipper are easily fabricated together by soft lithography. Applying two Pliant Zippers on different substrates enables them to be engaged semi-automatically in the alignment position. The aligned substrates are held tightly without any external support. Highly accurate alignment was achieved manually without the micro-adjustment required in conventional techniques. The experiments presented in this article demonstrate the high accuracy of the alignment. The misalignment range of the experiments is less than 1.9 μm.
1	We report the fabrication, functionalization and testing of microdevices for cell culture and cell traction force measurements in three-dimensions (3D). The devices are composed of bent cantilevers patterned with cell-adhesive spots not lying on the same plane, and thus suspending cells in 3D. The cantilevers are soft enough to undergo micrometric deflections when cells pull on them, allowing cell forces to be measured by means of optical microscopy. Since individual cantilevers are mechanically independent of each other, cell traction forces are determined directly from cantilever deflections. This proves the potential of these new devices as a tool for the quantification of cell mechanics in a system with well-defined 3D geometry and mechanical properties.
0	This work presents a systematic investigation on coordination chemistry of a pharmaceutical agent pamoic acid (H2PA), and also reveals the significant function of supramolecular interactions in managing the resultant crystalline networks with the incorporation of secondary co-ligands. Assemblies of pamoic acid with transition metal ions under similar conditions yield a series of eleven MnII, CuII, ZnII, and CdII complexes, in the absence/presence of the organonitrogen ligands such as 2,2′-bipyridyl (2,2′-bipy), 1,10-phenanthroline (phen), and 4,4′-bipyridyl (4,4′-bipy). These compounds, together with the DMF solvate of pamoic acid, have been characterized by IR, elemental analysis, and single-crystal X-ray diffraction techniques. Generally, these complexes display similar 1-D pamoate-bridged coordination arrays (or 2-D coordination layers by introducing bridging 4,4′-bipy). Remarkably, distinct extended network architectures are further constructed with the aid of weak secondary interactions especially aromatic stacking. Amongst them, complexes 6, 8, 9, and 12, which exhibit unusual interpenetrating networks of (6,3) layers or 3-D 5-connected frameworks regulated by stacking forces, are representative paradigms of this research. Structural evolution under the co-ligand intervention in this series of complexes, as well as the general coordination rule of pamoate, has been further discussed. Thermal stability of these crystalline materials and fluorescent properties of the polymeric ZnII and CdII complexes have also been explored.
0	Sulfonated poly(aspartic acid) (SPASP) of narrow polydispersity was successfully employed in the facile synthesis of porous calcium carbonate microspheres with regular trigonal star-like secondary structure units and significantly improved surface area (56.3 m2 g−1). Based on the CaCO3 particles morphology through different aging times, a mechanism for the formation of porous CaCO3 microspheres with trigonal star-like secondary structures in the presence of SPASP was proposed.
0	Synthesis and structural behaviours of a pyridine-containing NO2S2-macrocycle L and its soft metal complexes 1–4 with different types of coordination modes and topologies are presented. The reactions of L with AgPF6 in different ligand-to-metal ratios lead to the formation of two solid complexes with different topologies: an endocyclic 1:1 (L:M) complex 1a and an unprecedented 2:1 endo/exo-type complex 2. NMR titrations confirm that both silver(I) complexes with 1:1 and 2:1 ratios also retain in solution. In the reactions of L with HgCl2 and Hg(ClO4)2, anion-controlled exo- and endocyclic 1:1 complexes were afforded, respectively. The tendency to adopt this respective arrangement suggests the possibility that metal coordination modes and/or topologies including the stoichiometries can be controlled by varying ligand-to-metal ratios and anions.
0	The classical thermally driven transition from supermagnetic to blocked supermagnetic and quantum phase transition from magnetic long-range order to quantum superparamagnetic state have been observed in ultrasmall In2S3:Ce diluted magnetic semiconductors (DMSs). The In2S3:Ce nanoparticles (5–6 nm) were synthesized by a facile gas–liquid phase chemical deposition process using Ce(COOCH3)3, In(COOCH3)3 and H2S as source materials. X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) were used to characterize the structure, components, morphology and size. Photoluminescence emission spectroscopy (PL) demonstrates that the luminescence quantum efficiency increases with Ce addition and indicates the existence of Ce atoms in the structure. The magnetic properties reflect a strong f–f exchange interaction between the Ce ions. The Ce doped In2S3 nanoparticles are shown to exhibit a higher blocking temperature from superparamagnetic to magnetic long-range order state, and even show room-temperature ferromagnetism. The larger ionic radius of Ce results in a larger influence on carrier concentration, affecting the blocking temperature of the magnetic phase transition.
0	Taguchi robust design was applied to indicate the importance of some variables such as copper and oxalate ion concentrations, flow rate of reagent feeding to the reactor and temperature on the formation of CuC2O4 nano-disks by chemical precipitation. The prepared copper oxalate nano-disks under optimum conditions of synthesis have an average thickness of 60 nm. Meanwhile, CuC2O4 nano-disks as the precursor material were calcined at 350 °C under a static air atmosphere for thermal decomposition of the precursor and formation of copper oxide. CuO nanoparticles with average diameters about 55 nm and spherical morphology were obtained. Synthesized nanoparticles were characterized by SEM, XRD and FT-IR.
0	Large lattice mismatched heterostructures In0.78Ga0.22As/GaAs were grown with a low-temperature (LT) InGaAs buffer. Misfit dislocation arrays were observed at the LT-buffer/GaAs interfaces. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to investigate the microstructures of the heterointerfaces. The relationship between misfit dislocations and strain relaxation at the interface was analysed. It was found that strain redistribution gives rise to the discrepancy of interfacial structure and misfit strain relaxation for different samples. The experimental results are in favor of the conclusion and confirm the analysis we proposed.
0	A novel pH-responsive supramolecular polymer based on the pillar[5]arene/imidazolium cation recognition motif was successfully prepared. It was demonstrated that the binding strength between the monomer molecules in solution could be reduced by adding base, thereby leading to a decrease in the polymerization degree, while a reverse switch could be achieved by the addition of acid to change the monomer back to the cationic state. These processes were confirmed by 1H NMR, DOSY experiments, viscosity measurements and theoretical calculations. Moreover, a rod-like fiber was drawn from a high concentration solution of the monomer and characterized by SEM, providing direct evidence of the formation of a supramolecular polymer with high molecular weight and high degree of the linear chain extension. In this study, a reversible transition between the high-molecular-weight supramolecular polymer and the relatively low-molecular-weight one, that is, a control of the polymerization degree, was realized by simply altering the solution pH. These results are helpful for the future fabrication of adaptive and smart supramolecular materials with stimuli-responsiveness and special functions.
1	The synthesis of new, highly functional and dynamic polymeric materials has risen dramatically since the introduction of click chemistry in 2001. This diverse set of reactions has led to the synthesis of self-healing and dynamic polymers, the creation of hydrogels exhibiting finely tuneable gelation times and mechanical properties and to the temporal and spatial control of chemical reactions enabling the 3D patterning of gels and surfaces with high fidelity. Traditionally, the copper catalysed azide–alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC), Diels–Alder and thiol–ene click reactions have been utilised but, owing to the demand for more environmentally friendly means of synthesis and the need for more versatile and tolerant chemistry, the imine, hydrazone, and most recently, oxime carbonyl-condensations have seen an astonishing increase in application. This review will focus on the oxime click reaction for the development of functional polymeric materials.
0	Some biologically important indolylthiohydantoin derivatives were investigated electroanalytically by voltammetric determination. Based on this study, a simple, rapid, sensitive and validated voltammetric method was developed for the determination of the indolylthiohydantoin derivatives that are readily oxidized at carbon-based electrodes. Due to the similarity between electrochemical and biological reactions it can be assumed that the oxidation mechanisms taking place at the electrode and in the body share similar principles. The oxidative behavior of the indole derivatives was studied as a function of pH at a glassy carbon electrode in different buffer media. The characteristics of the corresponding electrode reaction were discussed. The studied molecules are extensively metabolized in vivo, mainly through oxidative processes and we assume that the oxidation of the indolic compounds occurs on the nitrogen atom in the indole ring of the molecule. A linear response was obtained in the different media for all the compounds with a detection limit of 1.96 × 10−6 M, 2.32 × 10−6 M, 1.44 × 10−6 M and 7.10 × 10−7 M for compounds 1, 2, 3 and 4 respectively.
0	This review describes first the synthesis of phosphorus dendrimers having positive charges either on the terminal groups or inside their structure. Then the properties of these positively charged dendrimers as catalysts, as fluorophores, for the modification of materials and the elaboration of nano-objects, but also for interacting with biological entities and for drug delivery will be emphasized.
0	A simple and routine chemical ionization method (CI) providing molecular weight information is developed for the unambiguous identification of 3,3-dimethyl-2-butanol known as pinacolyl alcohol (PA), a potential precursor for prohibited chemical weapons such as Soman, a nerve agent. This method meets the CI criteria used for the evaluation of proficiency tests conducted by OPCW avoiding use of reference chemical. In addition, a derivatization method using p-tolyl isocyanate for the analysis of PA using GC-MS has also been developed for the identification. This derivatization method facilitates the easy analysis of PA at low concentration present in environmental matrices. The efficiency of the derivatization is &gt;99% with 10 fold increase in the sensitivity of the GC-MS signal. The electron ionization mass spectral fragmentation of the p-tolyl isocyanate (PTI) derivatives of three isomeric alcohols is also established. The positive CI of PTI derivatives of these alcohols resulted in molecular ion information and meets the OPCW criteria for CI method of analysis. Further, the retention indices for all the studied alcohols after derivatization help the unambiguous identification of these compounds present in complex environmental matrices.
0	Li self-diffusion in Li2O-deficient LiNbO3 single crystals is investigated in the temperature range between 423 and 773 K (150–500 °C) by secondary ion mass spectrometry. A thin layer of ion-beam sputtered isotope enriched 6LiNbO3 was used as a tracer source, which allows one to study pure isotope interdiffusion. The diffusivities can be described by the Arrhenius law with an activation enthalpy of (1.33 ± 0.03) eV, which is in acceptable agreement with the migration energy of a single Li vacancy as determined by ab initio calculations given in the literature. Charge diffusivities as derived from impedance spectroscopy measurements on the same type of samples are identical to the tracer diffusivities within error limits. No indication of the formation of defect-complexes at low temperatures could be found in the diffusion behaviour.
0	The adsorption of hydrogen on structurally well defined PdAu–Pd(111) monolayer surface alloys was investigated in a combined experimental and theoretical study, aiming at a quantitative understanding of the adsorption and desorption properties of individual PdAu nanostructures. Combining the structural information obtained by high resolution scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), in particular on the abundance of specific adsorption ensembles at different Pd surface concentrations, with information on the adsorption properties derived from temperature programmed desorption (TPD) spectroscopy and high resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS) provides conclusions on the minimum ensemble size for dissociative adsorption of hydrogen and on the adsorption energies on different sites active for adsorption. Density functional theory (DFT) based calculations give detailed insight into the physical effects underlying the observed adsorption behavior. Consequences of these findings for the understanding of hydrogen adsorption on bimetallic surfaces in general are discussed.
0	A new concept of electrokinetic desalination using a CNT honeycomb is presented through molecular dynamics simulation. The preferential translocation of ions towards the outlets near two electrodes was realized by applying an electric field perpendicular to bulk fluid flow in a CNT network, which, in the meantime, generated deionized water flux discharged from the central outlets. The effects of the major factors such as electric field strength, numbers of separation units, diameter of CNT, and ion concentration on the desalination were examined. It was shown that over 95% salt rejection and around 50% fresh water recovery were achieved by the presented module by applying an electric field of 0.8 V nm−1. CNT diameter, which is critical to ion rejection without the electric field, had a marginal effect on the desalination of this new module when a strong electric field was applied. The desalination was also not sensitive to ion concentration, indicating its excellent workability for a wide range of water salinity, e.g. from brackish water to seawater. A potential of mean force profile revealed a free energy barrier as large as 2.0–6.0 kcal mol−1 for ions to move opposite to the implemented electrical force. The simulation confirmed the high potential of the CNT honeycomb in water desalination.
1	We have prepared hydrated salt filler assisted sponge like P(VDF-HFP) micro-porous electroactive films to fabricate a high performance flexible piezoelectric generator (FPG). These FPGs deliver up to 8 V of open circuit voltage under external stress and also generate enough power to turn on at least fifteen commercial blue light emitting diodes (LEDs) instantly. Furthermore, capacitors have been successfully charged by repeated finger touches indicating the potential of the FPGs to be used as self-powered devices where different types of mechanical vibrations can be applied. The high performance of FPGs might be attributed to the co-operative contribution from the porous electret structure and electroactive nature of the P(VDF-HFP) film, as they also enhance the dielectric permittivity. This approach is simple, cost-effective, and well-suited for large-scale fabrication of high-performance FPGs.
0	Using a first principles approach combined with analysis of heuristic tight-binding models, we examine the connectivity dependence of two forms of quantum interference in single molecules. Based on general arguments, Fano resonances are shown to be insensitive to connectivity, while Mach–Zehnder-type interference features are shown to be connectivity dependent. This behaviour is found to occur in molecular wires containing anthraquinone units, in which the pendant carbonyl groups create Fano resonances, which coexist with multiple-path quantum interference features.
0	Tin telluride (SnTe) has recently attracted lots of interest due to its potential thermoelectric application as a lead-free rock-salt analogue of PbTe. However, pristine SnTe samples have high hole concentration due to the presence of intrinsic Sn vacancies, and shows a low Seebeck coefficient and high electrical thermal conductivity, resulting in poor thermoelectric performance. In this report, we show that zone-melted SnTe systems with additional Mn (1–7 mol%) can control the hole concentration by reducing the Sn vacancies, and modulate the electronic band structure by increasing the band gap and decreasing the energy separation between the light and heavy hole valence bands. Therefore, alloying with additional Mn enhances the contribution of the heavy hole valence band and significantly improves the Seebeck coefficient in SnMnxTe with the highest value of ∼270 μV K−1. A record power factor of 31.9 μW cm−1 K−2 has been obtained at 820 K. The maximum thermoelectric figure of merit ZT of ∼1.25 is found at 920 K for the high quality crystalline ingot of p-type SnMn0.07Te.
1	Numerous investigations have been carried out into the conversion of biogas into synthesis gas (a mixture of H2 + CO) over Ni/YSZ anode cermet catalysts. Biogas is a variable mixture of gases consisting predominantly of methane and carbon dioxide (usually in a 2:1 ratio, but variable with source), with other constituents including sulfur-containing gases such as hydrogen sulfide, which can cause sulfur poisoning of nickel catalysts. The effect of temperature on carbon deposition and sulfur poisoning of 90:10 mol% Ni/YSZ under biogas conversion conditions has been investigated by carrying out a series of catalytic reactions of methane-rich (2:1) CH4/CO2 mixtures in the absence and presence of H2S over the temperature range 750–1000 °C. The effect of ceria-doping on carbon dioxide reforming, carbon deposition and sulfur tolerance has also been investigated by carrying out a similar series of reactions over ceria-doped Ni/YSZ. Ceria was doped at 5 mol% of the nickel content to give an anode catalyst composition of 85.5:4.5:10 mol% Ni/CeO2/YSZ. Reactions were followed using quadrupolar mass spectrometry (QMS) and the amount of carbon deposition was analysed by subjecting the reacted catalyst samples to a post-reaction temperature programmed oxidation (TPO). On undoped Ni/YSZ, carbon deposition occurred predominantly through thermal decomposition of methane. Ceria-doping significantly suppressed methane decomposition and at high temperatures simultaneously promoted the reverse Boudouard reaction, significantly lowering carbon deposition. Sulfur poisoning of Ni/YSZ occurred in two phases, the first of which caused the most activity loss and was accelerated on increasing the reaction temperature, while the second phase had greater stability and became more favourable with increasing reaction temperature. Adding H2S significantly inhibited methane decomposition, resulting in much less carbon deposition. Ceria-doping significantly increased the sulfur tolerance of Ni/YSZ, however, in the presence of H2S ceria did not promote the reverse Boudouard reaction and at high temperatures carbon deposition was greater over ceria-doped Ni/YSZ. In order to further study the effects of ceria-doping, a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) was constructed with a ceria-doped anode cermet and its electrical performance on simulated biogas compared to hydrogen was tested. This fuel cell was subsequently ran for 1000 h on simulated biogas with no degradation in its overall electrical performance.
0	The SMM behaviour of dinuclear Ln(III)–Pc multiple-decker complexes (Ln = Tb3+ and Dy3+) with energy barriers and slow-relaxation behaviour were explained by using X-ray crystallography and static and dynamic susceptibility measurements. In particular, interactions among the 4f electrons of several dinuclear Ln(III)–Pc type SMMs have never been discussed on the basis of the crystal structure. For dinuclear Tb(III)–Pc complexes, a dual magnetic relaxation process was observed. The relaxation processes are due to the anisotropic centres. Our results clearly show that the two Tb3+ ion sites are equivalent and are consistent with the crystal structure. On the other hand, the mononuclear Tb(III)–Pc complex exhibited only a single magnetic relaxation process. This is clear evidence that the magnetic relaxation mechanism depends heavily on the dipole–dipole (f–f) interactions between the Tb3+ ions in the dinuclear systems. Furthermore, the SMM behaviour of dinuclear Dy(III)–Pc type SMMs with smaller energy barriers compared with that of Tb(III)–Pc and slow-relaxation behaviour was explained. Dinuclear Dy(III)–Pc SMMs exhibited single-component magnetic relaxation behaviour. The results indicate that the magnetic relaxation properties of dinuclear Ln(III)–Pc multiple-decker complexes are affected by the local molecular symmetry and are extremely sensitive to tiny distortions in the coordination geometry. In other words, the spatial arrangement of the Ln3+ ions (f–f interactions) in the crystal is important. Our work shows that the SMM properties can be fine-tuned by introducing weak intermolecular magnetic interactions in a controlled SMM spatial arrangement.
0	An Ag grid/indium tin oxide (ITO) hybrid transparent electrode was developed for printable optoelectronic devices using inkjet printing. By inserting an inkjet-printed Ag grid between inkjet-printed ITO electrodes, the sheet resistance of the inkjet-printed ITO electrode was significantly reduced from 6.5 to 0.54 Ω/square. However, the optical transmittance of the Ag grid/indium tin oxide (ITO) hybrid electrode gradually decreased with decreasing Ag grid separation distance due to the scattering of light on the Ag grid lines. From the figure of merit values of the Ag grid/ITO hybrid transparent electrodes, the optimized Ag grid width for the hybrid electrodes was determined to be 3 mm, which is consistent with the calculated results. The low sheet resistance and fairly high optical transmittance of the Ag grid/ITO hybrid transparent electrode suggests its use as a transparent electrode for inkjet printing-based printable optoelectronic devices.
0	Abstract   Yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) powders from different manufacturers have been used to prepare atmospheric plasma-sprayed (APS) ceramic coatings with different porosity levels. While the particle morphology of the different powders was similar, the amount of impurities, especially silica, was different, varying between 100 and 1500 ppm. APS coatings were removed from the substrates and the porosity distribution was measured by mercury porosimetry. Typically porosity levels between 10 and 15% have been used. Free-standing coatings were investigated in the dilatometer during long-term (&gt;50 h) annealing at 1200°C. Additionally, the coefficient of thermal expansion was determined from expansion during heating. It turned out that the higher porosity levels, as well as the high impurity levels, led to a significant increase in the sintering rate of the coating during high-temperature annealing. A linear relationship between the total shrinkage after 60 h and the porosity, as well as the silica content, was used to describe the influence of the investigated parameters on the sintering behaviour in a more quantitative way.
0	Abstract   An atmospheric pressure RF torch-barrier discharge system with flowing plasma jet channel was studied as a tool for coatings of aluminum substrates by CeO  x   thin films. Cerium precursors were supplied to the plasma jet in the form of aerosol of the water solution of cerium salts. CeO  x   thin films were obtained on the Al substrate at certain deposition conditions. Properties of deposited CeO  x   films were studied by electron microprobe system. Surface of the films was analyzed by XPS method. ‘In situ’ emission spectroscopy of active plasma jet channel was performed in order to obtain more parameters about atmospheric plasma jet channel.
0	Abstract   The structure, mechanical properties, and machining performance of arc evaporated Ti–Al–O–N coatings have been investigated for an Al 0.66 Ti 0.34  target composition and O 2 /(O 2 +N 2 ) gas flow-ratio varied between 0 to 24%. The coating structure was analysed using SEM, EDX, XRD, XPS, TEM, and STEM. Mechanical properties were analysed using nanoindentation and the deformation behaviour was analysed by probing the nanoindentation craters. The coatings performances in cutting tests were evaluated in a turning application in low carbon steel (DIN Ck45). It is shown that the addition of oxygen into the arc deposition process leads to the formation of a dual layer structure. It consists of an initial cubic NaCl-structure solid solution phase formed closest to the substrate, containing up to 35 at.% oxygen (O/O+N), followed by steady-state growth of a nanocomposite compound layer comprised of Al 2 O 3 , AlN, TiN, and Ti(O,N). The addition of oxygen increases the ductility of the coatings, which improves the performances in cutting tests. At high levels of oxygen, (&gt; 13 at.%), however, the performance is dramatically reduced as a result of increased crater wear.
0	Although chromium nitride (CrN) coatings are an industry standard for hard wear-resistant thin films, methods of improving/modifying film properties are still being sought therefore this study has investigated the effects of N2 flow and bias pulsing. Chromium nitride can exist in two stable forms, Cr2N and CrN, which have differing physical and tribological properties. The predominant structure depends on the nitrogen gas flow rate during deposition. Another process parameter known to influence film properties is the use of mid-frequency pulsed biasing (100–350 kHz) at the substrate, which can significantly increase the ion current drawn at the substrate during ion etching and deposition. This study has, therefore, investigated the effects of both nitrogen gas flow rate and the use of mid-frequency pulsed biasing (100–350 kHz) on the structure and properties of reactively sputtered chromium nitride films. We investigated the variation of target voltage with N2 flow, and the films have been characterised using SEM, XRD, scratch adhesion testing, profilometry, and nanoindentation.
0	Abstract   Because of the problem of film peeling, it is generally difficult to obtain thick and well adherent diamond-like carbon (DLC) coatings on metallic substrates with good tribological properties. In this work, we propose to apply a plasma immersion ion implantation and deposition (PIII&amp;D) process in magnetic bottle configuration using high voltage glow discharge in order to deposit DLC films directly over 304 stainless steel (SS) alloy. In such configuration, two couples of coils wound outside the vacuum chamber are used to produce region of low magnetic field for plasma confinement (~ 60 G at the center axis). DLC coatings are characterized by Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and also morphologically by means of atomic force microscopy (AFM). Tribological behavior is investigated using a pin-on-disk tribometer, and after that, the scars are evaluated by means of SEM and Wyko NT1100 optical profiler. PIII&amp;D experiments in crossed fields have been demonstrated to be an effective system to synthesize DLC films with good adhesion, excellent resistance against wear as well as good dry lubricant surfaces.
0	Abstract   Hot-corrosion combined with erosion-corrosion is a severe problem in boiler tubes of Power Plant Boilers. One possible way to control hot corrosion is the use of thermal spray protective coatings. Cold gas dynamic spraying (CGDS), popularly referred to as cold spray (CS), is a promising technology for depositing protective coatings. Ni based alloys have been used for thermal spraying for various applications. In the current research work three different types of coatings NiCr, NiCrTiC and NiCrTiCRe were deposited by the cold spray technique on SA 516 steel. The performance of the coatings was evaluated in actual boiler conditions wherein the uncoated and coated steels were exposed to the superheater zone of a coal fired boiler for 15 cycles. The change in weight and thickness were noted and used for studying the kinetics of the erosion-corrosion. X-ray diffraction, surface and cross-sectional FE-SEM/EDS and X-ray mapping techniques were used to evaluate the as-coated and eroded-corroded specimens. It was observed that the coated specimens gave better performance than the uncoated steel. The development of oxides and spinels of nickel and chromium might have resulted in better performance of the coatings. The NiCrTiCRe coating established best erosion-corrosion resistance behavior amongst all the investigated specimens.
1	Partial denaturation of whey protein concentrates has been used to make protein powders with differing viscosity properties. PDWPC particles have been manufactured to have a range of aggregate sizes (3.3–17 μm) and structures (compact particle gel to open fibrillar gel). In solution the PDWPC samples show complex viscosity behaviour dependant on the size and morphology of the PDWPC aggregate particles. For the same protein content the compact particles have a lower viscosity than open, fibrillar particles. The viscosity also appears to depend on the surface structure of the particles, with particles of a similar size, but having a rougher surface giving higher viscosity than similar smooth particles. The viscosity of the WPC, MPWPC and PDWPC solutions are explained in terms of the postulated interactions between the protein aggregates in solution.
1	Abstract   In order to understand the promoting effect of char in different states on the steam reforming of biomass-derived tar during the gasification process,  Fallopia Japonica  stem (FJS) chars were prepared at different pyrolysis temperatures with different pyrolysis time, and used as the catalyst for the reforming of tar derived from FJS itself in a fixed-bed reactor. As-prepared FJS chars were characterized using Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), Fourier Transform Infra Red spectroscopy (FT-IR), and Brunauer–Emmet–Teller (BET) surface area measurement for clarifying the relationship between the promoting effect and the physical and chemical structures of the char. It was found that BET surface area, chemical structure, and the contents of alkaline and alkaline earth metals (AAEM) in the char, which were obviously affected by pyrolysis temperature and time, had significant effect on char reactivity as well as the catalytic activity on tar reforming. The char obtained at lower temperature (
1	Abstract   The dielectric properties of Shanxi anthracite and Shandong bituminous coals in China are investigated in the low-terahertz (THz), W-band of frequency from 75 GHz to 110 GHz for the first time. In this frequency range, the complex dielectric constant of coal samples is obtained using the free space method. It is found that both the real parts of the dielectric constant for bituminous and anthracite decrease considerably with increasing frequency from 75 GHz to 110 GHz. The anthracite coals exhibit higher real and imaginary part values than bituminous coals. The imaginary part of the coal samples exhibits a more significantly decreasing trend in the frequency range from 90 GHz to 110 GHz compared with frequencies below 90 GHz. The dielectric properties of all the coal samples are strongly dependent on the moisture content of the coals. Increasing moisture content leads to higher complex dielectric constant values. The effect of moisture on the dielectric properties of coals depends substantially on the influence of moisture content on the transmission and reflection of THz wave in the coals. The results show that the transmission coefficient of anthracite and bituminous exhibits an exponentially decreasing trend with increasing moisture content (from 0% to 10%). However, the reflection coefficient seems to follow a Gaussian-like changing trend with increasing moisture content, reaching a maximum around 4.5%.
1	Abstract   A numerical solution is developed to investigate the generation and propagation of small-amplitude water waves in a semi-infinite rectangular wave basin. The three-dimensional wave field is produced by the prescribed “snake-like” motion of an array of segmented wave generators located along the wall at one end of the tank. The solution technique is based on the boundary element approach and uses an appropriate three-dimensional Green function which explicitly satisfies the tank-wall boundary conditions. The Green function and its derivatives which appear in the integral equation formulation can be shown to be slowly convergent when the source and field points are in close proximity. Therefore, when computing the velocity potentials on the wave generators, the source points are chosen outside the fluid domain, thereby ensuring the rapid convergence of these functions and rendering the integral equations non-singular. Numerical results are shown which illustrate the influence of the various wavemaker and basin parameters on the generated wave field. Finally, the complete wave field produced by the diffraction of oblique waves by a vertical circular cylinder in a basin is presented.
0	Abstract   Fractographic and microstructural examinations were performed by scanning and transmission electron microscopy, respectively, and correlated, for the thermally sensitized 304 stainless steel (SS) irradiated to 1.2×10 21  n/cm 2  ( E &gt;1 MeV) in BWR condition and fractured intergranularly in 290 °C inert gas. Intergranular (IG) cracks were present in the specimen surface region and the fracture surface periphery. The fractography showed IG facets decorated with various patterns of linear features/steps. The microstructures of the surface region revealed linear features/deformation twinning near grain boundaries and microtwins at grain boundaries. The linear features identified on the [1 1 1] habit plane varied depending on deformation levels. The high number density of microtwins evidences a high local stress and strain concentration, which may nucleate and initiate at the impingement of deformation twins and grain boundaries. Therefore we conclude that a mechanism causing the IG cracking mechanically in non-aqueous environment is present in the highly irradiated austenitic SS.
0	Abstract   Intumescent mat material is widely used to support ceramic substrates in catalytic converters and behaves very much like hyper-foam material under compressive loading. Experiments show that compressive loading curves depend on the ram speed and the number of cycles. The unloading curves show different slopes and paths that depend less on the ram speed and number of cycles. The slopes of the unloading curves decrease as the plastic strain increases; this is referred to as “softening” in this study. The effects of rate, softening, and plastic deformation must be considered to model the mechanical response of intumescent mat material. Finite deformation theory is applied with a multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient tensor. The developed theory is implemented as an implicit finite element algorithm in ABAQUSTM/STANDARD. The necessary material parameters are extracted from experiments. Numerical simulations show good agreement with experiments.
0	Abstract   In a recent paper (Hasbroucq et al., 2010  [1] ), we have analyzed the long-term behavior of a discrete mechanical system with temperature-dependent elastic properties under cyclic thermomechanical loadings. In particular, we have shown that the residual stress and strain fields are time-dependent when shakedown occurs and thus the Halphen's (2005)  [2]  conjecture is not a necessary shakedown condition. Also, we have shown that there is loss of convexity of elastic and shakedown domains in the Bree diagram. In order to examine if these facts are related to the finite dimensional character of the structure and to the uniaxial path load in Hasbroucq et al. (2010)  [1] , we consider here a continuum media, namely a thin plate undergoing a biaxial loading. Linear and quadratic dependence of Young's modulus and Poisson's coefficient with respect to the temperature are considered. Closed-form expressions of the asymptotic responses of the plate under a given thermomechanical history loads are presented for shakedown, alternating plasticity and ratcheting regimes. In addition, the present study shows that in the Bree diagram, the elastic domain is convex while the shakedown zone is not so and, contrary to Hasbroucq et al. (2010)  [1] , the residual (elastic) strain field is time-independent for shakedown. Therefore, the present example falls in the Halphen's shakedown conjecture.
0	In this work, interfacial mechanical properties between solid bodies in contact are monitored by using ultrasonic guided waves. An experimental system formed by two solid aluminum rods (50.8 mm in diameter) axially loaded against a thin aluminum plate to control contact interfacial stiffness was used. Guided waves were excited on the aluminum thin plate using a pitch-catch configuration. The axially applied load on the aluminum rods was varied from 0 MPa to 30 MPa. The effect of loading and unloading cycles on the guided wave propagation parameters was experimentally and theoretically studied. Results of the experiments indicate that applied load affects the attenuation and induces mode conversion of the studied S0 vibration mode. Attenuation as a function of interfacial conditions was numerically determined using the stiffness matrix method and then compared to experimental results.
1	Abstract   The aim of this study is to characterize a paraffin-based cold storage tank. Novel experimental results are presented for this system which combines a significant amount of paraffin (1450 kg) immersed around 18 spiral-shaped coils disposed in counter-current flow. The paraffin has a phase-change temperature in the range 4–8 °C as measured by a 3-layer calorimeter. Different tests have been carried out with a constant mass flow rate and supply temperature. Around 31% of the paraffin has hardly any contact with the coils and hereby acts as a dead mass. The results show the importance of natural convection within the phase-change-material, particularly during the melting process. The highest efficiency has been achieved for the lowest supply temperatures and mass flow rates of the heat transfer fluid.
0	Abstract   A photoelectrochromic cell is fabricated with a transparent working electrode coated with a Ag–TiO 2  nanocomposite, which exhibits multicolor photochromism, a silver counter electrode, and an electrolyte containing silver ion. When the electrodes are short-circuited (drawing mode), the Ag–TiO 2  coating is active in photochromism, whereas the activity is substantially suppressed, when the cell is open-circuited (display mode). The cell can be initialized by applying a voltage (−1.0 V).
0	Abstract   A conventional three-electrode system is fabricated to prepare a novel modified amperometric immunosensor for rapid determination of α-1-fetoprotein (AFP) in human serum. The immunosensor was prepared by entrapping thionine (Thi) into Nafion (Nf) to form a composite Thi/Nf membrane, which yield an interface containing amine groups to assemble gold nanoparticles (nano-Au) layer for immobilization of α-1-fetoprotein antibody (anti-AFP). The stepwise self-assemble procedure of the immunosensor was further characterized by means of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and cyclic voltammetry (CV). The factors influencing the performance of the resulting immunosensor were studied in detail. After the immunosensor was incubated with AFP at 37 °C for 10 min, the CVs current decreased linearly in concentration ranges of AFP from 5.0 to 200.0 ng/mL with a detection limit of 2.4 ng/mL. Moreover, the studied immunosensor exhibited good accuracy, high sensitivity and long-term stability (&gt;3 months). The proposed method is economical and efficient, making it potentially attractive for clinical immunoassays.
1	A one-pot total synthesis of aspergillamide and analogues by a solution phase Ugi multi component reaction (MCR) is described. The reaction is easily performed in 96-well plates and offers a facile access to diverse aspergillamide analogue compound libraries. The antibiotic and cytotoxic activity of these compounds is measured. Several of them are more potent than the natural product.
1	The discovery and structure–activity relationship of 1,2-diarylimidazole piperazine carboxamides bearing polar side chains as potent and selective cholecystokinin 1 receptor (CCK1R) agonists are described. Optimization of this series resulted in the discovery of isopropyl carboxamide 40, a CCK1R agonist with sub-nanomolar functional and binding activity as well as excellent potency in a mouse overnight food intake reduction assay.
1	Abstract   The design, synthesis and delivery potential of a new type of benzenesulfonamide cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor prodrug is investigated using celecoxib. The approach involves a double prodrug that is activated first by azoreductases and then by cyclization triggering drug release.  We studied the intramolecular aminolysis of the acylsulfonamide. The cyclization was surprisingly rapid at physiological pH and very fast at pH 5. The prodrug is activated specifically under conditions found in the colon but highly stable in the presence of human and rodent intestinal extracts. Finally, the prototype with celecoxib was transported much more slowly in the Caco-2 transepithelial model than the parent. The design therefore shows significant promise for the site specific delivery of benzenesulfonamide COX-2 inhibitors to the colon.
1	Abstract   Potential RNA targets for chemical probes and therapeutic modalities are pervasive in the transcriptome. Oligonucleotide-based therapeutics are commonly used to target RNA sequence. Small molecules are emerging as a modality to target RNA structures selectively, but their development is still in its infancy. In this work, we compare the activity of oligonucleotides and several classes of small molecules that target the non-coding r(CCUG) repeat expansion (r(CCUG)exp) that causes myotonic dystrophy type 2 (DM2), an incurable disease that is the second-most common cause of adult onset muscular dystrophy. Small molecule types investigated include monomers, dimers, and multivalent compounds synthesized on-site by using RNA-templated click chemistry. Oligonucleotides investigated include phosphorothioates that cleave their target and vivo-morpholinos that modulate target RNA activity via binding. We show that compounds assembled on-site that recognize structure have the highest potencies amongst small molecules and are similar in potency to a vivo-morpholino modified oligonucleotide that targets sequence. These studies are likely to impact the design of therapeutic modalities targeting other repeats expansions that cause fragile X syndrome and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, for example.
1	Abstract   A series of selective TNNI3K inhibitors were developed by modifying the hinge-binding heterocycle of a previously reported dual TNNI3K/B-Raf inhibitor. The resulting quinazoline-containing compounds exhibit a large preference (up to 250-fold) for binding to TNNI3K versus B-Raf, are useful probes for elucidating the biological pathways associated with TNNI3K, and are leads for discovering novel cardiac medicines. GSK114 emerged as a leading inhibitor, displaying significant bias (40-fold) for TNNI3K over B-Raf, exceptional broad spectrum kinase selectivity, and adequate oral exposure to enable its use in cellular and in vivo studies.
1	abstract The exploration of the effect of substituents at C7 and C8 of the 5-phenylmorphans on their afﬁnity foropioid receptors was enabled by our recently introduced “one pot” diastereoselective synthesis thatprovided C7-oxo, hydroxy and alkyl substituents, C8-alkyl substituted 5-phenylmorphans, and com-pounds that had a new cyclohexane ring that includes the C7 and C8 carbon atoms of the 5-phenylmorphan. The afﬁnity of the 5-phenylmorphans for opioid receptors is increased by a C8-methyl substituent, compared with its C7 analog. The afﬁnity of the newly synthesized compounds isgenerally for the m -opioid receptor, rather than the d -or k -receptors. Addition of a new cyclohexane ringto the C7 and C8 positions on the cyclohexane ring of the 5-phenylmorphans enhances m -receptor af-ﬁnity, bringing the K i to the subnanomolar level. Unexpectedly, the N-methyl substituted compoundsgenerally had higher afﬁnity than comparable N-phenethyl-substituted relatives. The conﬁgurations oftwo compounds were determined by single-crystal X-ray crystallographic analyses.Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.
1	Abstract   Novel representative of the important group of biologically active benzosuberones bearing 2, 4-thiazolidenone moiety was synthesized as potential anticancer agents ( 6a – j ). These compounds were synthesized in good yields from Knoevenagel condensation of compounds  2a – b  with thiazolidenone derivatives  3a – e  in the presence of sodium acetate and glacial acetic acid. The  in vitro  cytotoxicity of these compounds was evaluated against different human cancer cell lines (A549, HeLa, MDA-MB-231, MCF-7) and normal cell line, HEK293. Compound  6a  exhibited promising cytotoxicity with IC 50  values ranging from 2.98 to 13.34 μM against all the tested cancer cell lines, HeLa, A549, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231, while compound  6g  showed potent cytotoxicity against human breast adenocarcinoma cell line (MCF-7, IC 50  value of 1.91 μM).
1	Serving as a crucial component of mammalian cells, cholesterol critically regulates the functions of biomembranes. This review focuses on a specific property of cholesterol and other sterols: the tilt modulus χ that quantifies the energetic cost of tilting sterol molecules inside the lipid membrane. We show how χ is involved in determining properties of cholesterol-containing membranes, and detail a novel approach to quantify its value from atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Specifically, we link χ with other structural, thermodynamic, and mechanical properties of cholesterol-containing lipid membranes, and delineate how this useful parameter can be obtained from the sterol tilt probability distributions derived from relatively small-scale unbiased MD simulations. We demonstrate how the tilt modulus quantitatively describes the aligning field that sterol molecules create inside the phospholipid bilayers, and we relate χ to the bending rigidity of the lipid bilayer through effective tilt and splay energy contributions to the elastic deformations. Moreover, we show how χ can conveniently characterize the “condensing effect” of cholesterol on phospholipids. Finally, we demonstrate the importance of this cholesterol aligning field to the proper folding and interactions of membrane peptides. Given the relative ease of obtaining the tilt modulus from atomistic simulations, we propose that χ can be routinely used to characterize the mechanical properties of sterol/lipid bilayers, and can also serve as a required fitting parameter in multi-scaled simulations of lipid membrane models to relate the different levels of coarse-grained details.
0	Abstract   Absolute rate coefficients of the reaction of ethynyl radical with methane were measured for the first time at higher temperatures by a pulsed laser photolysis/chemiluminescence (PLP/CL) technique. Ethynyl radicals (HCC) radicals were generated pulsewise upon excimer laser photodissociation of acetylene at 193 nm and pseudo-first-order exponential decays of thermalized HCC were monitored in real-time by the    CH  (  A     2   Δ    →    X     2   Π   ) chemiluminescence produced by their reaction with O 2 . The rate coefficients  k (HCC+CH 4 ), over    295⩽T    (  K  )   , exhibit strong non-Arrhenius behaviour, being    k(T)=1.39×10     −18   T     2.34±0.40   exp  [(380±180)    K  /T]    cm     3     molecule     −1     s     −1    . Calculations at the CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pvTZ level reveal that the direct H-abstraction yielding HCCH+CH 3  has the lowest energy barrier of about 10 kJ mol −1 .
1	Abstract   Two chiral conformers of the optically active molecule naproxen have been identified in its high resolution electronic spectrum, differing only in the orientation of the attached  iso propionic acid group relative to the naphthalene ring. Both conformers exhibit  b -type spectra, indicating that the  S  1  states of the isolated molecules are similar to those of other 2-substituted naphthalenes. The measured rotational constants of the left- and right-handed forms of both conformers are identical to within the experimental error, ±0.1 MHz (∼1:10 9 ), indicating that they are enantiomers of each other, not diastereomers. The naphthyl ring with its attached methoxy group is insufficient to provide chiral discrimination.
1	Abstract   Utilizing a comprehensive test set of 205 clusters of atmospheric relevance, we investigate how different DFT functionals (M06-2X, PW91,  ω B97X-D) and basis sets (6-311++G(3df,3pd), 6-31++G(d,p), 6-31+G(d)) affect the thermal contribution to the Gibbs free energy and single point energy. Reducing the basis set used in the geometry and frequency calculation from 6-311++G(3df,3pd) → 6-31++G(d,p) implies a significant speed-up in computational time and only leads to small errors in the thermal contribution to the Gibbs free energy and subsequent coupled cluster single point energy calculation.
0	Abstract   Extended coupled cluster (ECC) method has been implemented extensively for the calculation of molecular properties. In this Letter we report the potential energy surface (PES) study using coupled and a decoupled approximation of ECC. HF, N 2  and C 2  are studied as test systems. N 2  and C 2  being doubly and triply bonded, are considered to be interesting systems for PES study. We compare our results with full CI (FCI) results wherever available. Decoupled approach within ECC framework shows good convergence for all the molecules.
0	Abstract   The application of Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) for the analysis of both solid and molten silicon has been developed. This technique provides fast and reliable chemical characterization of silicon. This work will present the investigation of experimental parameters such as buffering gas nature and pressure in order to find the most suitable conditions to quantify boron in solid silicon. These results show that the signal to background ratio (SBR) is improved by both the use of helium and argon instead of air and by reducing the pressure to 500 mbar. Using calibrated samples, calibration curves were prepared for boron and limits of detection of the order of 0.2 ppm were obtained working at a distance of 50 cm from the sample. Additionally, the capabilities of LIBS to analyze molten silicon (1410 °C) was demonstrated, opening the way for LIBS to be used as a process analytical technique.
0	Abstract   In this work, a relatively simple and sensitive method for separation/preconcentration of trace lead from natural waters prior to its determination by electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry has been proposed. The method is based on the extraction of Pb–dithizone chelate with coacervates made up of lauric acid in the presence of potassium ions and methanol. Several important factors affecting extraction efficiency such as pH, concentration of lauric acid and dithizone, ionic strength, incubation and centrifugation time were investigated and optimized. After separation of aqueous bulk solution from surfactant-rich phase, the final extract was redissolved by using 500 μl of methanol acidified with 0.2 mol l − 1  HNO 3 . Under the optimized conditions (using initial sample volume of 10 ml), enrichment factor of 17.0, detection limit of 0.12 μg l − 1 , quantification limit of 0.38 μg l − 1 , relative standard deviation of 4.2% (for 2 μg l − 1  of Pb;  n  = 26), linearity of the calibration graph in the range of 0.5–4.0 μg l − 1  (with correlation coefficient better than 0.995) were achieved. The method was validated by the analysis of certified reference material (TMDA-61). Extraction recoveries for the CRM, spiked model solutions and spiked natural water samples were in the range of 91–96%. Finally, the method was applied to the separation/preconcentration and determination of trace lead in natural waters.
0	Abstract   The self- and foreign (Ar, N 2 , and O 2 )-pressure effects on the submillimeter-wave absorption line profiles have been investigated for the  J =26–25 and 25–24 rotational transitions of N 2 O using the AIST terahertz spectrometer. By fitting the observed absorption profiles with the Galatry functions, the integral intensity, line-center position, Lorentzian width and contraction parameter were determined for each absorption line. The obtained pressure-broadening coefficients are consistent with the literature values reported for infrared spectra. The pressure dependence of contraction parameter was determined for the self-effect. The line shifts were found to be small.
1	Abstract   In 1674 Thomas Willis reported that the presence of urine ‘as sweet as honey’ was the pathognomonic sign of diabetes mellitus. In the 19th Century several reactions for the detection of glucose in urine were proposed and glucose measurement became common in the laboratories that were being set up in Europe. A case of diabetes mellitus, diagnosed by Namias, the head of the Women’s Section of the Medicine Department of Venice Hospital, was reported in 1863 in the ‘Giornale Veneto di Scienze Mediche’ which contains clinical and laboratory information. A 34-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital for polydypsia, polyuria, bulimia and fatigue. Urine was weighed for 2 months (2–10 kg day−1) and the relative density ranged from 1.045 to 1.038. Glucose was measured in the urine using Moore, Trommer and Fehling reagents. A few days after admission a urine sample showed 7.69 parts/100 parts of urine and a blood sample showed 547 mg of glucose/100 g of serum. The assays were carried out in the Clinical Laboratory of Venice Hospital, founded in 1863, directed by Giovanni Bizio, one of the first chemists who graduated at Padua University. In 1863 chemical analyses were commonly carried out in Venice as in the other parts of Habsburg empire.
1	Abstract   Iatrogenic vascular injury during lumbar disk surgery, although rare, is a serious complication, and when it does occur, can be sudden and life-threatening. The risk of injury to the pelvic vessels intra-operatively can be explained by the close proximity of the retroperitoneal vessels to the vertebral column therefore causing injury to the anterior longitudinal ligament, which can give access to the retroperitoneal space. If signs of circulatory instability are noted during lumbar disk surgery, early diagnosis of vascular injury and urgent transperitoneal surgery or emergency stenting can save the patient's life. Here, is presented the case of a 52-year-old man who underwent an elective lumbar discectomy for a rightward disk herniation in the L4–L5 intervertebral space and died 12 h after the operation for a hemorrhagic shock due to a severe intra-abdominal hemorrhage following iatrogenic left common iliac artery and vein perforation during lumbar discectomy.
1	Abstract   As research has shown that knowledge concerning the health risks and benefits of oral contraceptive (OC) use is a contributor to OC compliance, the following study examined an educated sample of young women to determine the level of knowledge concerning the risks and benefits of OC use. A 28-item questionnaire was developed by the research team and distributed to female undergraduate students. Five questions were designed to assess the respondent’s knowledge of OC. Overall, it found that OC users answered 71.9% of the questions correctly, whereas non-users answered significantly fewer questions correctly. As well, the number of correct responses increased with academic year, indicating that younger women were less knowledgeable about OC. The results of this study indicate that despite increased efforts to educate women, knowledge of OC remains a major problem, even in a sample of women with relatively high socio-economic status.
1	The amino acid-catalyzed direct enantioselective one-step de novo synthesis of carbohydrates using dihydroxyacetone phosphate mimetics as donors and aldehydes or in situ generated imines as acceptors is presented. The addition of water significantly accelerates as well as improves the enantioselectivity of the biomimetic aldol and Mannich reactions. The C3+Cn methodology presented herein is a direct entry to orthogonally protected C-5 and C-6 ketoses (e.g., ribulose, tagatose and piscose) and deoxy- and aminosugars such as 4-amino-4-deoxy-fructose.
1	A highly enantioselective one-pot synthesis of linear homoallylic alcohols with terminal ester functionality has been achieved. The reactions were controlled by ordered addition of reagents and catalysts, ensuring complete consumption of aldehyde. The synthetic utility of this strategy has been demonstrated in a short synthesis of a low boiling point intermediate for grahamimycin A.
1	Neutral cyclic dimers of bile acid incorporating triazole and nonaromatic CH binding segments exhibit unique fluoride coordination properties and the formation of a 1:2 complex is confirmed. Remarkably, the aliphatic CH donors, which are activated and stabilized by the hyperconjugation as well as the elec- tron-withdrawing effect of attached N-triazole and carbonyl groups, can present higher binding affinity than their triazole counterparts.
0	Abstract   The paper presents a review of recent studies of complexes of Ni(II) and Fe(II) coordinated by diphosphine ligands with amine bases incorporated into the ligand chelate rings. The role of the bases in the second coordination sphere in mediating rapid intramolecular M–H/N–H exchange as well as intermolecular exchange with protons and in promoting the coupling of proton- and electron-transfer processes has been studied. Factors that favor efficient proton relay properties for the pendant amines have been established and the information has been used to develop efficient electrocatalysts for both hydrogen oxidation and production.

0	Abstract   Peroxynitrite is a reactive oxidant produced in vivo in response to oxidative and other stress by the diffusion-limited reaction of nitric oxide and superoxide. This article is focused on the identification of free radical intermediates of uric acid formed during its reaction with peroxynitrite. The experimental approach included the ESR spin trapping of the radical generated from the reaction between uric acid and peroxynitrite at pH 7.4 and mass spectrometry studies of the trapped radicals. Using PBN ( N - tert -butyl-α-phenylnitrone) as the spin trapping agent, a six-line ESR spectrum was obtained and its hyperfine coupling constants,  a  N  = 15.6 G and  a  H  = 4.4 G, revealed the presence of carbon-based radicals. Further structural identification of the PBN–radical adducts was carried out using liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry. After comparison with the control reactions, two species were identified that correspond to the protonated molecules (M + 1) at  m/z  352 and 223, respectively. The ions of  m/z  352 were characterized as the PBN–triuretcarbonyl radical adduct and the  m/z  223 ion was identified as the PBN–aminocarbonyl radical adduct. Their mechanism of formation is discussed.
1	Radiotherapy and chemotherapeutic agents can effectively induce apoptosis through generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Cancer cells frequently express high levels of ROS-scavenging enzymes, which confer resistance to ROS-mediated cell death. Keap1 (Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1) sequesters and promotes the degradation of the antioxidant response element-binding transcription factor Nrf2 (nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2). In non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines and NSCLC patients, Keap1 is often present as a biallelic mutant that results in constitutive activation of Nrf2 function, which contributes to cytoprotection against oxidative stress and xenobiotics. To identify small molecules that inhibit antioxidant responses and increase apoptotic death after radiotherapy, we screened a chemical library containing 8000 synthetic compounds using a cell-based luciferase assay system. 4-(2-Cyclohexylethoxy)aniline (IM3829) inhibited the increase in Nrf2-binding activity and expression of the Nrf2 target genes induced by treatment with tertiary butylhydroquinone or radiation. Combined treatment with IM3829 and radiation significantly inhibited clonogenic survival of H1299, A549, and H460 lung cancer cells. IM3829 significantly increased ROS accumulation in irradiated cells compared with cells exposed to radiation alone and led to apoptotic cell death, as confirmed by caspase-3 and PARP cleavage. In mice bearing H1299 or A549 lung cancer xenografts, IM3829 together with radiation inhibited tumor growth more effectively than radiation alone. Our findings suggest that IM3829 could be a promising radiosensitizer in lung cancer patients, particularly those with high expression of Nrf2.
1	Abstract   Cardiovascular benefits of ubiquinone have been previously demonstrated, and we administered it as a novel therapy in an experimental model of type 2 diabetic nephropathy. db/db and dbH mice were followed for 10 weeks, after randomization to receive either vehicle or ubiquinone (CoQ10; 10 mg/kg/day) orally. db/db mice had elevated urinary albumin excretion rates and albumin:creatinine ratio, not seen in db/db CoQ10-treated mice. Renal cortices from db/db mice had lower total and oxidized CoQ10 content, compared with dbH mice. Mitochondria from db/db mice also contained less oxidized CoQ10(ubiquinone) compared with dbH mice. Diabetes-induced increases in total renal collagen but not glomerulosclerosis were significantly decreased with CoQ10 therapy. Mitochondrial superoxide and ATP production via complex II in the renal cortex were increased in db/db mice, with ATP normalized by CoQ10. However, excess renal mitochondrial hydrogen peroxide production and increased mitochondrial membrane potential seen in db/db mice were attenuated with CoQ10. Renal superoxide dismutase activity was also lower in db/db mice compared with dbH mice. Our results suggest that a deficiency in mitochondrial oxidized CoQ10 (ubiquinone) may be a likely precipitating factor for diabetic nephropathy. Therefore CoQ10 supplementation may be renoprotective in type 2 diabetes, via preservation of mitochondrial function.
0	Abstract   An analytical approach for selenium speciation using liquid chromatography (LC) coupled with ultra-violet (UV) and inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) was developed. The separation of the investigated selenium species, selenites, selenates, selenomethionine, selenocystine, selenocystamine and dimethyldiselenide was accomplished in less than 6 min on a BIO Wide Pore RP-18 column using sodium salt of  n -octanesulfonic acid as ion-pairing modifier. The on-line detection of the separated selenium species was performed using UV spectrometry at the optimum wavelength of 192 nm, obtained by the UV spectra of the investigated individual selenium species. ICP-AES was also used as element specific on-line detector, after its coupling with the chromatographic system. The UV and ICP-AES detectors were compared for their suitability, including sensitivity and detection limits, for the on-line quantification of the six selenium species. The developed LC–UV as well as LC–ICP-AES techniques were successfully applied to a selenized yeast candidate reference material, after its enzymatic extraction with protease XIV. It was found that the described LC–UV technique is suitable for the determination of selenomethionine, the main selenium compound in the yeast, with an accuracy of 5%, although the UV detector is not element specific and it is rarely used for selenium speciation. This finding can prove valuable for routine laboratories to perform selenium speciation in such materials.
1	Abstract   An extremely sensitive monoboronic acid based fluorescent sensor for glucose was developed. This was carried out by assembling a fluorescent monoboronic acid, 3-aminophenylboronic acid (PBA) indirectly onto gold surface via its electrostatic interaction with cysteine (Cys) that was directly assembled on the gold surface. The formation of self-assembled bilayers (SAB) was confirmed and primarily characterized by cyclic voltammetry and X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS). The SAB containing PBA was found fluorescent and its fluorescence showed an extremely high sensitivity to the presence of glucose and other monosaccharides such as galactose and fructose with quenching constants at 10 8  M −1  order of magnitude compared to those at 10 2  M −1  in bulk solutions. The quenching constants were found to vary in the order of    d  -  glucose  &gt;  d  -  galactose  &gt;  d  -  fructose  &gt;  d  -  mannose    that is different from that in bulk solution which shows the highest binding affinity toward  d -fructose and very low sensitivity toward glucose. The reported monoboronic acid based SAB fluorescent sensor showed the highest sensitivity towards glucose with the capacity of detecting saccharides of concentration down to nanomolar level. It was also demonstrated that the fluorescence from PBA/Cys/Au can be easily recovered after each measurement event and therefore also represents a new reusable method for immobilizing reagent in fabricating chemosensors.
0	Abstract   A novel chromium(0)-promoted three-component alkyne–triene higher-order cycloaddition process is presented. The transformation features tethered alkynes participating in a tandem [6π+2π], [6π+2π] cycloaddition event with cyclic trienes serving as the third reactant. Isomerically homogeneous products possessing five rings and six stereogenic centers are isolated from this reaction in good to excellent yield.
1	Abstract   Reactions of 2-(N-methylanilino)-3-formylchromones with a number of bifunctional nucleophiles, involving substitution of N-methylanilino moiety and/or condensations with 3-formyl function have provided an easy access to a variety of potentially biologically active hetero-annelated chromones, novel macrocycles, and tetradentate ligands having intact chromone moiety.
1	Abstract   An efficient and versatile synthetic method for the preparation of new fused bicyclic lactams  3a and 3b  is described. The spirane cyclopentane nucleus was easily installed by diallylation of the pyroglutamate derivative  18  followed by ring-closing metathesis (RCM). A more practical and stereoselective method for the allylation of the α-methoxy carbamate  21 , involving the use of InCl3 as a Lewis acid, was developed. In the crucial coupling reaction of the diastereomeric mixture of cis- and trans-pirrolidine derivatives  5a and 5b  with N-Cbz vinyl phenylalanine only the cis isomer was found to react. An RCM reaction on the dipeptides  25a and 25b  followed by catalytic hydrogenation, gave the final epimeric bicyclic lactams  3a and 3b . The same synthetic sequence on the model compound  7 , lacking the spiro cyclopentane nucleus, is also reported.
0	Abstract   A simple procedure for the synthesis of  N , N , N ′-trialkyl-1,8-diaminonaphthalenes is described. It consists in partial demethylation (dealkylation) of commercially available proton sponge [1,8-bis(dimethylamino)naphthalene] and some of its derivatives at heating with HBr–KI–DMF system. Limitation, scope and a possible mechanistic pathway for the reaction are discussed. For isomeric 8-dimethylamino-1-methylamino- and 1-dimethylamino-8-methylamino-4-nitronaphthalenes, X-ray measurements have been conducted. The first examples of complete realkylation reactions in the naphthalene proton sponges are reported.
1	The reactions of enantiopure azetidine-2,3-diones with unmodified ketones or nitromethane were catalyzed by proline and N-methylephedrine, respectively, to give the corresponding 3-functionalized 3-hydroxy-β-lactams with good yields and total diastereoselectivities. It was observed that the use of both enantiomers of proline or of N-methylephedrine does result in identical levels of stereocontrol in the aldol and nitroaldol reactions.
1	Abstract   A study on transition metal catalyzed alkyne cyclotrimerization of unsymmetrically bromo-substituted diynes with ethynyltrimethylsilane was carried out to prepare bicyclic bromobenzene key intermediates for the total synthesis of five potential tyrosine kinase 2 inhibitors. Two different pre-catalysts (Cp*RuCl(cod) and [Rh(cod) 2 ]BF 4 /BINAP) and different reaction conditions have been examined.
1	Abstract   Arylnaphthalene lactones, which are natural lignans and isolated from a wide range of plants, exhibit significant biological activity, including anticancer and antiviral activities. In this work, we have developed a versatile and convergent synthetic method for arylnaphthalene lactones, which involves the use of benzoin condensation and thermal intramolecular cyclization for preparing the key intermediate, naphthol. A high-yielding Suzuki reaction is utilized to introduce the aryl group to the C9 position of the naphthalene lactones, which allows for the construction of the arylnaphthalene lactone skeleton.
1	A new and simple fluorescent chemosensor 1, based on julolidine and tryptophan moieties, has been synthesized and characterized. The sensor 1 displayed a selective and sensitive detecting ability for aluminum (III) ion by ‘OFF–ON’ fluorescent response in aqueous solution. This sensing mechanism might be due to the inhibition of CN isomerization, and the activation of chelation enhanced fluorescence (CHEF). This sensing mechanism of 1 for Al3+ was supported by theoretical calculations. Moreover, sensor 1 had a low detection limit (6.4 μM), which is below than the WHO recommendation level (7.41 μM) for drinking water. Importantly, the chemosensor 1 could be applied to living cells to detect Al3+. Therefore, the sensor 1 can be employed as a practical fluorescent chemosensor for recognition of Al3+ in aqueous solution.
1	Abstract   Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is the most active component in environmental system, and its chemical and structural characteristics are most likely to affect its biodegradation. DOM has several different fluorophores whose fluorescent characteristics contain a lot of information about structure and functional groups. Fluorescence spectroscopy and Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) were used to examine the structural and biodegradable characteristics of DOM extracted from fermentation effluent of swine manure slurry. Humic-like acid, fulvic-like acid and protein-like fluorophores were observed in fluorescence spectra. Fluorescence index (FI) indicated that the fluorophores in the samples were representative of both terrestrial and microbially-derived organic matter. FTIR spectroscopy showed that DOM featured aliphatic C H, aromatic C C and carbohydrate C O functional groups. With PARAFAC model, four fluorescent components were identified: component 1 (protein-like), component 2 (soluble microbial byproduct-like), component 3 (non-humic like) and component 4 (fulvic-like). Component 1 was a dominant fluorescent component. Components 2, 3 and 4 were degraded by microorganisms as the anaerobic fermentation processes. The C/N ratio of DOM in F1 has a more significant decrease than that in F0, indicating the loss of carbon (CH4 and CO2) during this process. The C/N ratio of DOM in F2 obviously increased when additional swine manure slurry was added.
1	A method for the extraction of clenbuterol from calf urine samples using a molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) has been developed. The aim was that the final extracts from the MIP should allow quantitation of clenbuterol down to 0.5 ng/mL urine using HPLC with UV detection. The MIP was produced using brombuterol as a template and the selectivity of the MIP, for clenbuterol, was tested against a non-imprinted polymer (produced without template) and was found to be high. After loading of 5 mL diluted centrifuged urine, selective binding was established in acetonitrile-acetic acid (98:2). For further elution of interferences, 0.5 M ammonium acetate buffer pH 5 and 70% acetonitrile in water was used. Clenbuterol was eluted using 1% trifluoroacetic acid in methanol, which was evaporated and reconstituted in buffer. Results from the HPLC analyses showed that the extraction of clenbuterol using MIP is linear in the range 0.5-100 ng/mL with good precision (4.3% for 0.6 ng/mL and 2.1% for 6.0 ng/mL) and accuracy (96.7% for 0.6 ng/mL and 96.7% for 6.0 ng/mL). The recoveries were 75%. The results show that the method offers a selectivity and sensitivity that make the quantitation of 0.5 ng clenbuterol/mL urine by HPLC-UV possible and a competitive alternative to state-of-the-art routine analytical methods.
1	Analytical methods for the simultaneous analysis of lindane, chlorpyriphos, z-chlorfenvinphos, endosulfan A and B, 4,4'-DDE, 4,4'-TDE, acrinathrine, bromopropylate, tetradifon, coumaphos and fluvalinate in pure beeswax samples are studied. For the analysis of bleached beeswaxes, a liquid-liquid extraction with acetonitrile followed by a clean-up on polymeric cartridges is the best option in terms of recovery and precision. However, some interferences that hinder the identification and quantification of important varroacides are found when non-bleached beeswaxes are analyzed. The analysis of all compounds in the latter samples require a clean-up by coupling an ODS cartridge before the polymeric cartridge. Considerations about the influence of the matrix in the quantitative analysis by a classical external standard calibration are also made and the use of a matrix-matched calibration is advised. Recoveries resulted to be about 100% with coefficients of variation between 10% and 20% (n = 5) for concentrations of 0.5 and 5 mg/kg.
1	We have developed an ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-atmospheric pressure photoionization-tandem mass spectrometric (UHPLC-APPI–MS/MS) method for the simultaneous quantitative analyses of several oxysterols and vitamin D metabolites in mouse brain and cell line samples. An UHPLC-APPI-high resolution mass spectrometric (UHPLC-APPI-HRMS) method that uses a quadrupole-time of flight mass spectrometer was also developed for confirmatory analysis and for the identification of non-targeted oxysterols. Both methods showed good quantitative performance. Furthermore, APPI provides high ionization efficiency for determining oxysterols and vitamin D related compounds without the time consuming derivatization step needed in the conventionally used electrospray ionization method to achieve acceptable sensitivity. Several oxysterols were quantified in mouse brain and cell line samples. Additionally, 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 was detected in mouse brain samples for the first time.
1	A new on-line multidimensional system for sequential trapping and individual elution and separation of peptides based on their molecular weight is described. By sequentially using two chemically different trapping columns, a polymethacrylate monolith and a packed C18 one, peptides from complex samples can be on-line trapped and divided into two fractions, containing respectively mainly medium-large peptides and smaller peptides. Then, by means of two switching valves working in parallel, the two fractions were individually separated by reversed phase chromatography. The whole gradient consisted of two subgradients, with the first one dedicated to the separation of smaller peptides and the second one to the separation of larger peptides. Such configuration allowed to identify up to 1476 proteins in a standard E. coli tryptic digest, with improved performance, increased average sequence coverage and reduced single unique peptide identifications compared to a conventional shotgun proteomics configuration comprising only the C18 trapping column and the analytical column.
1	Abstract   This paper describes glucose nanosensors based on the co-electrodeposition of a poly(vinylimidazole) complex of [Os(bpy) 2 Cl] +/2+  and glucose oxidase (GOD) on a low-noise carbon fiber nanoelectrodes (CFNE). The SEM image shows that the osmium redox polymer/enzyme composite film is uniform. The film modified CFNE exhibits the classical features of a kinetically fast redox couple bound to the electrode surface. A strong and stable electrocatalytic current is observed in the presence of glucose. Under the optimal experimental conditions, the nanosensor offers a highly sensitive and rapid response to glucose at an operating potential of 0.22 V. A wide linear dynamic rang of 0.01–15 mM range was achieved with a detection limit of 0.004 mM. Compared with the conventional gold electrode, the nanosensor possessed higher sensitivity and longer stability. Successful attempts were made in real time monitoring rabbit blood glucose levels.
0	The field of selenium speciation has been studied for decades and the growing interest in this field seems never to reach a plateau. Although powerful techniques based on mass spectrometry are nowadays used for selenium determination/speciation, few laboratories can support the high cost of such techniques. The hyphenation of chromatography to atomic absorption or atomic fluorescence spectrometry (AAS or AFS) is still a reliable and low-cost alternative for routine laboratories. In this work we present the most important parameters dealing with selenium speciation along with the latest trends in this subject, namely in the items related with sample treatment and hyphenation techniques with AAS and AFS detection.
0	Abstract   In our study, the development of amino functionalized carbon coated magnetic nanoparticles (NH 2 -CC-MNPs) and their usage for electrochemical detection of hybridization of nucleic acids have been aimed. Firstly, NH 2 -CC-MNPs were prepared by coating of pristine Fe 3 O 4  nanoparticles with two layers via caramelization and silanization processes respectively. After the morphological characterization with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) it was seen that NH 2 -CC-MNPs was spherical shaped and in 28 nm sized. Investigation of chemical composition with the help of scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM/EDX) and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was showed incorporation of carbon and APTES to the structure of NH 2 -CC-MNPs. Magnetic property of NH 2 -CC-MNPs after two layered coatings was demonstrated with electron spin resonance (ESR) technique and g factor was calculated as 2.6. In the second part of this study, optimization studies have carried out onto the surface of NH 2 -CC-MNPs prepared in saltless phosphate-tween 20 buffer (PBTw) for the analysis of DNA hybridization. The thiol linked DNA probe sequence representing to the Hepatitis B virus (HBV) concentration, target DNA sequence concentration, the most productive hybridization time and the selection of the nanoparticle surfaces have been researched. The electrochemical detection of DNA hybridization was investigated using PGE in combination with differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) technique by measuring the guanine oxidation signal. The detection limit was calculated in the linear target DNA concentration range of 5–25 µg/mL and it was found to be 1.15 µg/mL (20 pmol in 110 µL solution). It has been intended to be more reproducible, more sensitive and faster results with developed biosensor technology.
1	Abstract   Cross-linking of dextran can be established by derivatization of the polysaccharide with methacryloyl groups followed by polymerization of an aqueous solution of this methacrylated dextran with an initiator system consisting of potassium peroxydisulfate (KPS) and N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylethylenediamine (TEMED). Microspheres with a hydrogel character can be obtained by performing the polymerization in an aqueous two phase system of PEG and methacrylated dextran. In order to reach a maximal conversion of methacrylate groups, using a minimal amount of KPS and TEMED, the aim of this work was to study the polymerization kinetics as a function of the reaction parameters, e.g. the KPS or TEMED concentrations, the degree of methacrylate substitution (DS), temperature, the polymer concentration in both phases and the volume ratio of the phases. As expected, the polymerization rate was greater when higher concentrations of KPS and TEMED were used. A higher methacrylate concentration yielded a greater polymerization rate as well. A quantitative analysis of the kinetics of the reaction revealed that the order was 0.41±0.02, 0.53±0.03 and 0.99±0.29 for KPS, TEMED and methacrylate, respectively. These orders were in agreement with a kinetic model derived for the polymerization reaction. The activation energy was    16.1±1.4    kJ  /  mol  .    When the equilibrium water content of the dextran phase was 70%, the final conversion of methacrylate groups was around 90% and was reached within one hour, even at relatively low concentrations of KPS and TEMED. At water contents of 50%, a lower final conversion (75%) was observed. Further, a higher viscosity of the dextran enriched phase resulted in a lower polymerization rate. The results presented in this paper give insights into the kinetics of the polymerization of dextran-bound methacryloyl groups, which can be exploited to prepare protein loaded dextran microspheres using minute amounts of initiating species.
1	Abstract   A novel fluorinated tetramethyl-substituted diphenylmethanediamine, α,α-bis(4-amino-3,5-dimethylphenyl)-3′-trifluoromethylphenylmethane (TFPM) was synthesized via a straightforward two-step procedure with high yield, which was then employed to react with 3,3′,4,4′-benzophenonetetracarboxylic dianhydride (BTDA) to afford soluble and inherent photoimageable polyimide BTDA–TFPM [PI(BTDA–TFPM)]. Experimental results indicated that PI(BTDA–TFPM) possesses good combined chemical and physical properties, of which thermal stability with initial thermal decomposition temperature of 526 °C and glass transition temperature of 298 °C. The polyimide has excellent solubility both in strong bipolar solvents, such as NMP and DMAc, and in common organic solvents, such as THF and dioxane, etc. Strong and flexible polymer coatings or films could be prepared by just casting the polymer solution on glass substrate, followed by thermal baking at a temperature lower than 200 °C. The novel polyimide has good electric insulating properties and low dielectric constant and dissipation factor. Fine photopattern could be processed by directly exposing the polyimide coating upon UV i-line, followed by developing with an organic solution developer.
1	Abstract   Detailed characterization of low molecular weight byproducts of oxidative polymerization of aniline is given. Presence of these compounds in the final product of polymerization strongly influences its macroscopic properties, such as density, solubility, etc., and they should be removed for the sake of reproducibility of properties of the polymer. We focused our research on separation and identification of the low molecular weight compounds, which are created during the polymerization process. We also compared the results obtained for room temperature and 0 °C polymerization products. Polymerization at −30 °C was also carried out but only very small amounts of the low molecular weight products were produced.
1	The effects of primary and quaternary amine modified montmorillonite (MMT) on the nanocomposite formation in an ethylene/propylene/diene rubber (EPDM) were studied. The organoclay was introduced in 10 parts per 100 rubber (phr) amount in the related recipes. X-ray diffraction spectra (XRD) were recorded in various stages of their processing in order to get information about the intercalation process. The curatives found to play a crucial role, as they promote the intercalation/exfoliation phenomena. Incorporation of MMT modified with octadecylamine (MMT-PRIM) in the EPDM and its more polar version (contains maleic anhydride grafted EPDM, EPDM-MA) resulted in intercalated and exfoliated structures, respectively. Deintercalation of the clay (collapse of the layers), generated in both EPDM and EPDM-MA during vulcanization, was attributed to the reactivity of the PRIM and to its ability to participate in complex formation with the curatives (vulcanization intermediates). This explanation was supported by the non-collapse of the MMT layers when the less reactive modifier, viz. octadecyltrimethylamine served as MMT intercalant (MMT-QUAT). In the latter case the corresponding nanocomposite contained mostly intercalated clay layers based on XRD and transmission electron microscopic (TEM) results.
1	Abstract   The structural evolution of PVDF upon uniaxial stretching has been investigated by means of in situ SAXS/WAXS experiments. Special attention has been paid to the change in plastic deformation mechanisms as a function of draw temperature. Of prime importance with respect to electroactive properties, the present study confirms that the α to β crystal phase transformation occurs in the whole temperature range between T g  and T m . However two different plasticity mechanisms are evidenced. In fact, the α c  crystalline relaxation, attributed to intracrystalline molecular motions, strongly impacts the deformation behavior. In the high temperature domain, where all mobilities related to the α c  relaxation are unlocked, plasticity occurs by crystal block shearing and subsequent fibrillation, while within the α c  transition range cavitational modes interfere with the fibrillation process, at the expense of global ductility. A morphological evolution scheme is proposed in the light of the in situ SAXS/WAXS data.
0	Abstract   Different chain length of conjugated polymers based on 4,6-dithien-2-ylthieno [3,4-c] [1,2,5]-thiadiazole (DTTTD) have been extended to investigate the structural, electronic and optical properties of (DTTTD)N donors in both vacuum and solvent environments using density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) calculations. The calculated results reveal that the bond length alternation (BLA), the HOMO–LUMO energy gap (Eg), Fermi energy level position (EF) and optical band gap (Eopt) of corresponding donors with N ≥ 5 (where N = 5 is the effective conjugated length (ECL) of DTTTD-based extended polymers) become size-consistent. The moderately-polar solvent environment cause of more stabilizing HOMO and LUMO energy levels, lower transition energy (TE), larger transition dipole moment (μij) and higher oscillator strength (f) of DTTTD investigated polymers. Therefore, the red-shifted in absorption spectra is occurred with respect to the vacuum state. In addition, the external electric field (Fext) smoothly affects optical properties of investigated donors. Based on our calculations, it was found that the trimer of DTTTD-based extended polymers is the most suitable donor to design the high-performance organic solar cells (OSCs) possessing a narrow HOMO–LUMO energy gap, highest exciton life time, broad and intense absorption spectra that cover the solar spectrum leads to maximum light-harvesting efficiency (LHE), higher charge transfer (CT) ability and high open-circuit voltage (VOC). On the other hand, the value of VOC of larger extended polymers decreased due to the HOMO upward-shifted.
0	Abstract   The effect of thermal annealing up to 15,000 h between 300 °C and 500 °C on the corrosion resistance of the duplex stainless steel (DSS) 7MoPLUS has been investigated by using the DLEPR test. Spinodal decomposition in 7MoPLUS is unabated even after annealing for 15,000 h and no healing has been observed. The possible healing mechanisms in this temperature range (back diffusion of Cr atoms from the Cr-rich ferrite (α Cr ) and diffusion of Cr atoms from the austenite) and its absence in the present steel have been discussed.
0	Abstract   Interest in materials degradation in supercritical water (SCW) increased significantly after the Generation IV International Forum selected the supercritical water-cooled reactor as one of six concepts for investigation. While a significant body of literature now exists on alloy corrosion in SCW, most studies have focused on the metal side of the metal–water interface. Using new data and a selective review of corrosion in SCW, this paper highlights how changes in SCW density change the corrosion mechanism, and highlights the close link between corrosion in SCW and high-temperature steam above 500 °C. Key issues in test methodologies are also discussed.
0	Abstract   In this work, we introduce an efficient methodology to assess the delamination mechanism of epoxy coating from steel substrate combining spectroscopic and analytical techniques. To reflect the competence of this approach, different samples were prepared by applying epoxy/polyaminoamide layers on untreated, acid and alkaline pretreated substrates. The results obtained from XPS and energy dispersive X-ray analyses describe delamination of the coatings on differently pretreated surfaces during the pull-off test. EIS measurements demonstrated that acid treatment improves the resistance against cathodic delamination, while XPS analysis provided useful data about coating delamination from the substrate.
1	Abstract   The diverse effects of progesterone on female reproductive tissues are mediated by the progesterone receptor (PR), a member of the nuclear receptor family of ligand-dependent transcription factors. Thus, PR is an important therapeutic target in female reproduction and in certain endocrine dependent cancers. This paper reviews our understanding of the mechanism of action of the most widely used PR antagonist RU486. Although RU486 is a competitive steroidal antagonist that can displace the natural hormone for PR, it’s potency derives from additional “active antagonism” that involves inhibiting the activity of PR hormone agonist complexes in  trans  through heterodimerization and competition for binding to progesterone response elements on target DNA, and by recruitment of corepressors that have the potential to actively repress gene transcription. An additional functional role for PR has recently been defined whereby a subpopulation of PR in the cytoplasm or cell membrane is capable of mediating rapid progesterone induced activation of certain signal transduction pathways in the absence of gene transcription. This paper also reviews recent results on the mechanism of the extra-nuclear action of PR and the potential biological roles and implications of this novel PR signaling pathway.
1	In our earlier study, we have shown that rats fed spray-dried milk containing α-linolenic acid (LNA 18:3 n-3) or eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA 20:5 n-3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA 22:6 n-3) had significantly lower amounts of serum and liver cholesterol. To evaluate the mechanism for hypocholesterolemic effect of n-3 fatty acids containing milk formulation, we fed male Wistar rats with spray-dried milk containing linseed oil (LSO) (source of LNA) or fish oil (FO) (source of EPA + DHA) for 8 weeks. Feeding n-3 fatty acid containing milk formulation lowered the hepatic 3-hydroxy-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG Co A) activity by 17–22% compared to rats given control diet devoid of n-3 fatty acids. The cholesterol level in liver microsomes was found to be decreased by 16% and 20%, respectively, in LSO and FO containing formulation fed rats. The bile flow was enhanced to an extent of 19–23% in experimental groups compared to control animals. The biliary cholesterol and phospholipid secretion was increased to an extent of 49–55% and 140–146%, respectively, in rats fed n-3 fatty acid containing formulation. The increase in the total bile acids secretion in bile was mainly reflected on an increase in the levels of taurine conjugated bile acids. These results indicated that n-3 fatty acid containing spray-dried milk formulation would bring about the hypocholesterolemic effect by lowering HMG Co A reductase activity in liver and by increasing the secretion of bile constituents.
1	Abstract   Composite sheets consisting of phenolic resin filled with a mixture of reduced graphene oxide (RGO), γ-Fe2O3 and carbon fibers have been produced by compression molding. Its electrical conductivity lies in the range 0.48–171.21 S/cm. Transmission and scanning electron microscopy observations confirm the presence of nano particles of γ-Fe2O3 (∼9.8 nm) and carbon fiber (∼1 mm) which gives flexural strength to composite sheets. Thermogravimetric analysis show that the thermal stability of the sheets depend upon the amount of RGO and phenol resin in the composite. Complex parameters, i.e., permittivity (e* = e′ − ie″) and permeability (μ* = μ′ − iμ″) of RGO/γ-Fe2O3/carbon fiber have been calculated from experimental scattering parameters (S11 and S21) using theoretical calculations given in Nicholson−Ross and Weir algorithms. The microwave absorption properties of the sheets have been studied in the 8.2–12.4 GHz (X-Band) frequency range. The maximum shielding effectiveness observed is 45.26 dB, which strongly depends on dielectric loss and volume fraction of γ-Fe2O3 in RGO matrix.
0	Abstract   A new strategy for designing the morphology and the chemical/physical properties of carbon structures is developed by functionalization of porous carbon templates. In a thermal decomposition procedure self-prepared multilayer-graphene foams (GF) are coated with a nitrogen-containing carbon layer (NCL) which has a porous structure. The use of a nitrogen rich ionic liquid as precursor generates a NCL with a very high nitrogen level of 35.3 wt%. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first synthesis of a hierarchical structured N-GF with such a high nitrogen amount. Structural studies on the NCL confirm C5N and C3N4 species. Compared to uncoated GF it could be demonstrated that the functionalized porous carbon template (N-GF) has an increased electronic conductivity and electrochemical stability. Electrochemical characterizations of polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) prepared with Pt catalysts supported on N-GF show an increased performance which is attributed to improved mass transport properties and higher electronic conductivity of the porous composite material. Morphological, structural, chemical, and electrochemical characterizations were performed.
1	Abstract   The five new silanes C5Me3RSiMenCl3 − n (n = 3, R = i-Pr (5); n = 2, R = i-Pr (6); n = 2, R = s-Bu (7); n = 2, R = cyclohexyl (8); and n = 3, R = t-Bu (9)) were synthesized by reaction of 1-alkyl-2,3,4-trimethylcyclopentadienyl lithium salts with appropriate chlorosilane and characterized by NMR, MS, and IR spectra. At elevated temperatures (250–360 K), all the silanes undergo a non-degenerate sigmatropic silyl rearrangement, which generates non-equivalent structures a and b. The presence of minor structure c was observed in compounds 5 and 7 only. The Diels–Alder cycloaddition of 5 with strong dienophiles tetracyanoethylene (TCNE), and dimethylacetylenedicarboxylate (DMAD) provides compounds 10 and 11, which confirmed isomers a and b, respectively. The free energy of activation of b → a isomerization for compounds 5–8 evaluated from variable temperature NMR spectra show only marginal influence of group R on the 1,2-silyl shift rate. Moreover, in compounds 5 and 7, the process b → a was found significantly faster than b → c process in the above-mentioned temperature range.
1	Abstract   The ferrocene-based bis(pyrazol-1-yl)borate ligands [Fc2Bpz2]− ([2]−) and [Fc2BpzPh2]− ([2Ph]−) have been prepared (Fc: ferrocenyl; pz: pyrazol-1-yl; pzPh: 3-phenylpyrazol-1-yl). Treatment of [2]− and [2Ph]− with MnCl2 in THF leads to the complexes [Fc2Bpz2Mn(THF)(μ-Cl)2Mn(THF)pz2BFc2] (3) and [Fc2BpzPh2Mn(THF)Cl] (3Ph), respectively, which have been structurally characterized by X-ray crystallography. While there is clearly no ferrocene–MnII π-coordination in the solid-state structure of 3, short MnII–C5H4 contacts are established in 3Ph (shortest Mn–C distances: 2.780(2) A, 2.872(2) A). The cyclic voltammograms of K[2Ph] and 3Ph show the first ferrocene/ferricinium redox wave of 3Ph to be shifted anodically by 0.60 V compared with the first FeII/FeIII transition of K[2Ph].
1	Abstract   A series of poly(ether-imide)s (III) characterized by colorless, highly solubility was synthesized from 2,2-bis[4-(3,4-dicarboxyphenoxy)phenyl]propane dianhydride(BPADA) and various fluorinated aromatic diamines (Ia-h) in DMAc via polycondensation to form poly(amic acid) (II), followed by chemical (C) and thermal (H) imidization. These polymers had inherent viscosities ranging from 0.60 to 1.3 dL/g. These polyimides were highly soluble in a variety of organic solvent such as amide-type, ether-type and chlorinated solvents. Moreover, these poly(ether-imide) films were almost colorless, with an ultraviolet–visible absorption cutoff wavelength below 390 nm and low b* value (a yellowness index) of 4.6–18.0. The III series showed strength tensile of 72–101 MPa, elongation at break of 11–25%, initial modulus of 1.5–2.0 GPa. The glass transition temperature (Tg) of IIIa-h were in the range of 202–267 °C, and the decomposition temperature above 493 °C and left 40–65% char yield at 800 °C in nitrogen. They had the lower dielectric constants of 3.39–3.72 (1 MHz) and moisture absorptions in the range of 0.11–0.40%.
1	In this study novel, fully and partially bio-based polyamides containing spiroacetal moieties in the backbone derived from bio-glycerol and bio-ethanol were prepared and characterized. The renewable diamine employed to obtain a series of polyamides was synthesized by means of thiolene click chemistry and therefore contains flexible thioether as well as rigid spiroacetal moieties. Two different chemical pathways for the polymerization were investigated and evaluated. The polymerization of polyamide salts proved to be the most promising method and therefore salt polymerization was applied in the synthesis of polyamides with aliphatic and aromatic di-carboxylic acids. Subsequently, the structure of the polymers was confirmed by Maldi-ToF analysis and additionally thermal and mechanical properties were investigated revealing T-g's between 24 and 80 degrees C and ductile materials with moduli between 1.0 and 1.5 GPa. Both semicrystalline and amorphous polyamides were thermally stable and therefore suitable for thermal processing. In the end, degradation studies were performed on the acetal containing polyamides which showed that the polymers were stable at pH 3 and higher.
1	Abstract   Covalently cross-linked proteins are among the major modifications caused by the advanced Maillard reaction. In the present study, the formation pathway of the dideoxyosone N6-(2,3-dihydroxy-5,6-dioxohexyl)- l -lysine is shown. To elucidate the formation of this glucose-derived dideoxyosone  d -lactose (O-β- d -galp-(1 → 4)- d -glcp) and  d -glucose-6-phosphate were incubated with lysine in the presence of the trapping reagent o-phenylenediamine (OPD). Synthesis and unequivocal structural characterization were reported for the quinoxalines of the dideoxyosones N6-(5,6-dihydroxy-2,3-dioxohexyl)- l -lysine and N6-(2,3-dihydroxy-4,5-dioxohexyl)- l -lysine, respectively. Additionally, dicarbonyl compounds derived from  d -erythrose,  d -glycero- d -mannoheptose, and  d -gluco- l -talooctose were synthesized and structurally characterized.
0	Abstract   The structure of the title compound has been determined by X-ray diffraction at 190 K. The complex has an all  trans  configuration with an elongated tetragonally distorted octahedral CuO 6  chromophore. The elongated axis corresponding to the  trans -Cu–O(ether) bonds. The ligand molecules are bidentate via the carboxyl and the 3-ether O atoms; the 6-ether O atoms are not coordinated and are remote from the Cu centres. The bond lengths to the Cu centres are Cu–O(ether) 2.355 A, Cu–O(Carboxyl) 1.933 A and Cu–OH 2  1.995 A.  The EPR spectrum of both the powder and frozen solution forms is typical of a rhombic system with a  d   x  2 − y  2   1  electronic configuration. There were no significant differences in spectra recorded over the temperature range 77 K to room temperature. These results are discussed in relation to earlier published results on closely related oxa-carboxyl complexes.
0	Abstract   Hydrothermal reaction of Ln2O3 and 2,2′-thiodiacetic acid (H2tda) led to three chain-based two-dimensional (2D) lanthanide complexes, namely [Ln2(tda)3(H2O)2]n (Ln = Gd3+ (1), Tb3+ (2), Dy3+ (3)). These complexes exhibit enhanced stabilities with the decomposition temperature of around 300 °C and the insolubility in common organic solvents. Magnetic studies show that complex 1 exhibits weak antiferromagnetic coupling between the Gd3+ ions and a large magnetocaloric effect with −ΔSmmax = 39.2 J kg−1 K−1 and 94.8 mJ cm−3 K−1 at 7 T and 2 K. Complex 2 displays ferromagnetic and weak field-induced SMM behaviors, and complex 3 almost does not exhibit slow relaxation of the magnetization.
1	Abstract   2,2′-Selenobis(acetic acid), Se(CH 2 C(O)OH) 2 , crystallises in the space group  P 2 1 / c  with the cell dimensions at 253 K,  a =7.6693(1),  b =5.1911(1),    c=15.8812(2)    A    ,    β =94.908(1)°,    V=629.95(2)    A       3   ,    Z =4,    D      calc    =2.078    Mg    m     −3    ,    λ(  MoK     α   )=0.71073    A    ,      μ=5.90    mm     −1   .    The structure refined to  R  1 =0.0177 for 1727 reflections with  F  o &gt;4 σ ( F  o ). In the crystalline state the two carboxylic groups are  cis  to each other forming dimers with four fairly parallel and linear hydrogen bonds with O⋯O distances ranging from 2.628 to 2.702 A. The two Se–C–C bond angles are distinctly different, 110.2(1) and 116.4(1)°. The selenium atom is surrounded by an intramolecular O (OH) atom, the Se⋯O distance being 3.081 A, and by two intermolecular Se-atoms, both 3.752 A. A re-determination of the crystal structure of S(CH 2 C(O)OH) 2  at 253 K gave the following parameters:  a =5.0572(1),  b =17.7896(2),    c=6.6726(1)    A    ,      V=600.30(2)    A       3   ,    Z =4,    D      calc    =1.661    Mg    m     −3   ,    in space group  Pnma . The structure was solved as for the Se-compound and previous results by Paul [Acta Cryst. 23 (1967) 491] were confirmed. Theoretical calculations based upon density functional theory suggest that the energy difference between a closed dimer as observed for Se(CH 2 C(O)OH) 2 , and a linear chain as observed for S(CH 2 C(O)OH) 2 , is small. This indicates that the distinct differences observed between these structures may be due to minor differences in weak intermolecular forces, rather than a preference of the Se atom to make intramolecular non-bonding interactions with hydroxy O atoms.
1	Abstract   Interactions of five flavonoids with dsRNA and single stranded ssRNA were studied by UV/vis titrations. The results obtained supported the intercalative binding mode as a dominant interaction of studied flavonoids with dsRNA as well as major interaction with ssRNA. Furthermore, changes of the UV/vis spectra of flavonoids induced by addition of poly G or poly C, respectively, are significantly stronger than changes induced by double stranded poly G-poly C, pointing to essential role of the free poly G or poly C sequence (not hydrogen bonded in double helix). Exclusively poly G caused significant batochromic shift of the UV/vis maxima of all studied flavonoids, whereby the intensity of batochromic shift is nicely correlated to the number of OH groups of flavonoid. Unlikely to poly G, addition of poly A and poly U induced measurable changes only in the UV/vis spectra of flavonoids characterised by no OH (galangin) or three OH groups (myricetin) on the phenyl part of the molecule. Consequently, flavonoids with one- or two-OH groups on the phenyl part of the molecule (luteolin, fisetin, kaempferol) specifically differentiate between poly A, poly U (negligible changes in the UV/Vis spectra) and poly G (strong changes in the UV/Vis spectra) as well as poly C (moderate changes in the UV/Vis spectra).
0	Abstract   3-Benzoylmethyleneindol-2-ones, isatin based chalcones containing donor and acceptor moieties that exhibit excited-state intramolecular charge transfer, have been studied in different solvents by absorption and emission spectroscopy. The excited state behavior of these compounds is strongly dependent on the nature of substituents and the environment. These compounds show multiple emissions arising from a locally excited state and the two states due to intramolecular processes viz. intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) and excited state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT). Excited-state dipole moments have been calculated using Stoke-shifts of LE and ICT states using solvatochromic methods. The higher values of dipole moments obtained lead to support the formation of ICT state as one of the prominent species in the excited states of all 3-benzoylmethyleneindol-2-ones. The correlation of the solvatochromic Stokes-shifts with the microscopic solvent polarity parameter (      E    T    N      ) was found to be superior to that obtained using bulk solvent polarity functions. The absorption and florescence spectral characteristics have been also investigated as a function of acidity and basicity (Ho/pH) in aqueous phase.
0	Abstract   In this study, we synthesized two ionic liquids based on imidazolium: one is a monocationic and the other is a dicationic. They are respectively 1-Propyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide ([PrMIM + ][Br − ]) and trimethylene bis-methylimidazolium bromide ([M(CH 2 ) 3 IM 2+ ][2Br − ]). The structures of these two ionic liquids which are composed of ions with atoms of the same nature were first identified by  1 H, 13 C NMR, and then compared in a study by FT-RAMAN and FTIR/ATR spectroscopies.  FT-RAMAN spectras of the dicationic ionic liquid are richer in modes in the different spectral regions. Hence this richness seems to be a consequence of the passage from one to two rings in the imidazolium cation. In particular, the vibrational modes in the spectral ranges 700–600 cm −1 , 1700–1500 cm −1  and 3200–2700 cm −1  by FTIR/ATR seem to be sensitive to the change from mono to dicationic than in FT-RAMAN. The spectral range in which the intermolecular interactions are present (200-50 cm −1 ) is a marker of differentiation between the mono and the dicationic. The spectral ranges on 1700–1200 cm −1  and 3200–2700 cm −1  also show signs of upheaval between our two samples. We can also notice that there are much more active modes in FT-RAMAN spectroscopy than in FTIR/ATR spectroscopy.
0	Abstract   Cohen's bilinear class of shift-invariant space–frequency representations provides an automated means for extracting three-dimensional particle locations from in-line Fresnel holograms without any focusing. Choosing kernel parameters of a fixed-kernel representation in order to achieve the trade-off between auto-term sharpness and cross-term suppression while processing a multiple-particle hologram is a tedious task, especially if the hologram considered is crowded. Hence, this paper proposes an automatic kernel design procedure in order to eliminate this parameter selection task altogether and obtain a signal adaptive representation that matches the particular hologram analyzed. An ambiguity function (AF) domain analysis of a two-dimensional (2-D), multiple-particle hologram reveals AF slices of it that carry the auto-term information. By applying the Radon transform (RT) and the inverse RT to moduli of these slices successively, a 2-D discrete AF domain kernel that matches the hologram is obtained in separable form. This procedure is used in our fixed-frequency slice technique recently proposed for 2-D holograms, and also in computing complete space–frequency patterns for one-dimensional holograms, for particle-location analysis of them.
0	Abstract   The results of numerical simulations are reported modeling the behavior of a unidimensional Hybrid Stable–Unstable Resonator (HSUR) in strongly non-confocal configurations. Our analysis shows that such a resonator setup can produce cavity losses consistent with our design requirements and extract a Beam with Propagation Parameter better than 3 mm mrad.
0	Abstract   The plasmonic interference fields on the sub-wavelength gold gratings were directly investigated by using the collection-mode near-field scanning optical microscopy. For proper designs of structural size and periodicity of gratings, we found the plasmonic interference fields generated in the near filed on the gold strip surface. The light source was a visible laser, with a wavelength of 514 nm, illuminating in a normally incident direction to the sample. We demonstrated that the patterns of plasmonic interference fields can reach a narrow linewidth of  λ /7, which is considerably beyond the diffraction limit. The examined widths of the near-field intensities achieved 75–90 nm on the gold strip surface and 110–120 nm on the slit. We also observed that the near-field intensities from both plasmonic interference fields and near-field light of the slits were spatially uniform at the surface, which indicated the capability of near-field intensity redistribution. The numerical simulations by using two-dimensional finite difference time domain (2D-FDTD) method supported the experimental results with excellent consistency. The simulation results also indicated the strong dependences between the plasmon interference fields and polarizations of the incident light. The experimental and simulation results provided the substantial insights for the working mechanism and advanced applications of plasmonic nanopatterns.
0	Abstract   Modification of sodium fluoride crystal lattice by means of femtosecond laser pulses with  λ  max =800 nm, energy 0.5 mJ, duration 30 fs and repetition rate 1 kHz has been considered in the paper. Effective formation of simple and complex aggregate color centers and light scattering nanodefects in the channel of a laser beam in NaF crystal have been shown for the first time. Dependences of color centers concentration on the distance between the channel center and its periphery and along the channel have been presented. Influence of external focusing on color centers creation has been revealed. Explanations of the observed phenomena have been presented on the basis of nonlinear processes taking place under the effect of high-intensity femtosecond pulses.
0	Abstract   Fiber-optic transmission systems provide large capacities over enormous distances but are vulnerable to simple eavesdropping attacks at the physical layer. We classify key-based and keyless encryption and physical layer security techniques and discuss them in the context of optical multiple-input-multiple-output space-division multiplexed (MIMO-SDM) fiber-optic communication systems. We show that MIMO-SDM not only increases system capacity, but also ensures the confidentiality of information transmission. Based on recent numerical and experimental results, we review how the unique channel characteristics of MIMO-SDM can be exploited to provide various levels of physical layer security.
0	The perselenoborates RbBSe{sub 3} and CsBSe{sub 3} can be prepared from the metal selenides, amorphous boron, and selenium, in the case of TlBSe{sub 3} directly from the elements. The solid-state reactions were carried out in evacuated carbon-coated silica tubes at high temperatures. Single-crystal X-ray data were used to determine the crystal structures. Both alkali metal perselenoborates RbBSe{sub 3} and CsBSe{sub 3} crystallize in the monoclinic space group P2{sub 1}/c (RbBSe{sub 3}: a=7.279(2) {angstrom}, b=12.385(3) {angstrom}, c=6.169(2) {angstrom}, {beta}=105.67(3){degree}, Z=4, R1=0.0373, and wR2(F{sup 2})=0.1000; CsBSe{sub 3}: a=7.570(2) {angstrom}, b=12.791(4) {angstrom}, c=6.171(2) {angstrom}, {beta}=107.09(2){degree}, Z=4, R1=0.0332, and wR2(F{sup 2})=0.0751), while the thallium perselenoborate TlBSe{sub 3} crystallizes in the acentric monoclinic space group Ia (alternative setting to Cc) with the lattice constants a=6.166(2) {angstrom}, b=12.109(2) {angstrom}, c=7.031(2) {angstrom}, {beta}=113.88(3){degree}, Z=4, R1=0. 0423, and wR2(F{sup 2})=0.1157. All three compounds contain polymeric anionic chains of composition ([BSe{sub 3}]{sup {minus}}){sub n} formed by spirocyclically fused nonplanar five-membered B{sub 2}Se{sub 3} rings in which the boron atoms are in a tetrahedral BSe{sub 4} coordination. Vibrational spectra of the new compounds were measured and X-ray powder patterns are reported.
0	Abstract   Ceramic oxides exhibiting high lithium-ion mobility at room temperature receive broad attention as candidate electrolytes for lithium batteries. Lithium-stuffed garnets from the Li 7 La 3 Zr 2 O 12  group seem to be especially promising because of their high ionic conductivity at room temperature and their electrochemical stability. In this work, we discuss factors that affect formation of the garnet in its bulk form or in the form of thick and thin films. We demonstrate that zinc oxide can be applied as a sintering aid that facilitate the formation of the highly conducting cubic Li 7 La 3 Zr 2 O 12  garnet phase in a single-step sintering procedure. Based on our experience with the single-step sintering experiments, we successfully fabricated a thick-film membrane consisting of a garnet solid electrolyte using the tape casting technique.  In order to reduce the thickness of the electrolyte even further we investigated the fabrication of a thin-film Li 7 La 3 Zr 2 O 12  electrolyte by means of the pulsed laser deposition technique.
1	Data on the thermal stability of a plastic bonded explosive containing an oxidizer cyclotetramethylene tetranitramine (HMX), binder and plasticizer was required in order to satisfy the requirement of NAVORD OD 44811 and to obtain safety information for handling and use. The thermal stability of the PBX was determined by dynamic differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) in sealed/unsealed sample pans and by thermogravimetry (TG) in a nitrogen atmosphere using the variable heating rate method. Critical temperature for self-heating at various sample radii and the 500 day cookoff temperature were calculated. Thermal conductivity, specific heat and thermal diffusivity were determined at the critical temperatures in order to calculate the approximate time to explosion at these temperatures. A DSC self-heating half-life experiment was carried out to confirm that the overall decomposition of the PBX was first order. Published by Elsevier Science B.V.
1	Abstract   The road to market for drug compounds is a treacherous one, generally involving a huge temporal and financial investment. The role of structure-based drug design or lead optimisation ranges wildly in importance in different pharmaceutical companies. The adoption of these aids to provide routes to high affinity ligands has not received widespread acceptance. This is based on a number of factors, from the perceived failings of such methods, to the belief that rapid screening of compound libraries alone is the most effective way to discover drugs.  The panacea of being able to take a computer generated representation of the structure of a target site of a given biomolecule and rationally design an high affinity inhibiting compound has proved seemingly unreachable for three major reasons: (1) current capabilities in computing; (2) the requirement for atomic resolution structural detail; and (3) determination of how structural features can be related to the thermodynamics of interactions. It is the last of these points that this review seeks to address. In particular the use of isothermal titration calorimetry is discussed in the light of the accumulation of accurate thermodynamic data and examples are given where this has been applied to understand the structural aspects of formation of drug–biomolecular complexes.
0	Abstract   Four lanthanide complexes with a general formula [Ln(3,5-Dipr-2-OHBA)3(phen)]2 (Ln = La(1), Nd(2), Eu(3) and Tb(4); 3,5-Dipr-2-OHBA = 3,5-diisopropylsalicylate; phen = 1,10-phenanthroline) were synthesized and characterized by elemental analysis, infrared spectra (IR), powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) and thermogravimetry, differential scanning calorimetry techniques with Fourier transform infrared (TG/DSC–FTIR) technology. The luminescent properties of the complexes 3 and 4 were studied. The thermal decomposition processes of the title compounds were studied using the TG/DSC–FTIR coupling techniques. Heat capacities of the complexes were measured by DSC. And the values of the experimental heat capacities were fitted to a polynomial equation with the least-squares method. Based on the ﬁtted polynomial and thermodynamic equations, the smoothed heat capacities and thermodynamic functions (HT − H298.15 K), (ST − S298.15 K), and (GT − G298.15 K) were calculated.
0	Abstract   AgI nanocrystals were synthesized in reverse micelles. From X-ray diffraction patterns the nanocrystals were found to exhibit predominantly a zincblende structure. The exciton absorption was blueshifted and inhomogeneously broadened due to spatial confinement and the particle size distribution. “Free” exciton luminescence was weak. Instead, in addition to donor–acceptor recombination, a strong LO multiphonon Raman scattering was observed under resonant excitation in the exciton absorption. An LO phonon energy of 15.4 meV was derived and the incoming and outgoing resonances with the exciton were investigated. All results were consistent with the case of weak exciton confinement.
0	The sol–gel synthesis of Er3+ (1–5%) doped silica(83)–zirconia(17) waveguide materials with addition of aluminum (6–20 at%) giving a FWHM (4I13/2–4I15/2)&gt;60 nm is reported. Zirconia with high refractive index of 1.9 and low phonon energy is a good material compared with titania. The films were deposited on silicon or silica substrate by dipcoating technique using the precursors of Si(OC2H5)4 (Aldrich), Zr(C3H7O)4, CH3–CH(OH)–CH3, C5H8O2 , Al(NO3)3·9H2O, Er(NO3)3·5H2O and Yb(NO3)3·5H2O (Merck). The dipcoating rate of 2 and 3 mm/s were controlled by computer. Samples were calcinated at temperatures from 70 to 900 °C. The optical properties were studied by photoluminescent spectra and decay time. Influence of the Al3+ concentration and the heat treatment conditions for the Er3+ luminescent properties were studied. An energy transfer from 2F5/2 (Yb3+) to 4I11/2 (Er3+) multiplets is followed by a relaxation to the 4I13/2 (Er3+) and an efficiency luminescence of Er3+ (4I13/2–4I15/2) was clearly measured. It is interesting to indicate that the lifetime of few ms of Er3+ at 1530 nm in the sample Si(83)Zr(17)Al(6%)Er(1%)Yb(1%) is longer than for the sample without Yb ions. Multilayer thin films were prepared. The thickness, refractive index, the roughness about 2 nm and a propagation loss&lt;2.5 dB/cm were studied for active planar waveguide applications.
1	Abstract   A simple, inexpensive, environmentally friendly and efficient route for the synthesis of bis-indolyl methane derivatives by the reaction of indole or  N -methyl indole with aldehydes using pentafluorophenylammonium triflate (PFPAT) as a catalyst is described. PFPAT organocatalyst is air-stable, cost-effective, easy to handle, and easily removed from the reaction mixtures.
1	Abstract   1,1,2,2,3,3,4-Heptafluorocyclopentane is a new generation of green solvent. It was synthesized by the liquid-phase fluorination reactions from hexachlorocyclopentadiene to 1-chloroheptafluoro-cyclopentene in the presence of KF in DMF and by the vapor-phase hydrogenation reaction from 1-chloroheptafluorocyclopentene to 1,1,2,2,3,3,4-heptafluorocyclopentane in the presence of Pd-based hydrogenation catalyst. Quantum chemical calculations for the isomers energies using Gaussian09 were conducted to verify the chemical equilibriums between isomers of trichloropentafluorocyclopentene or dichlorohexafluorocyclopentene in the fluorination reactions. Possible mechanisms for 1,1,2,2,3,3,4-heptafluorocyclopentane synthesis were proposed.
1	We approach channel-facilitated membrane transport using a stochastic model based on considerations of particle diffusion inside the channel pore. This model allows us to rationalize the experimental observation that metabolite-specific biological channels exhibit affinities to their metabolites. We demonstrate that there is an optimal attractive interaction between the channel and the particle that maximizes the particle flux through the channel. A model in which the translocating solute jumps between neighboring binding sites is also analyzed. It is shown that the results predicted by the diffusion model can be recovered from the analysis of the binding-site model in a special limiting case. The binding-site model also describes the flux through a narrow channel where molecules cannot jump one over the other, and the regime of single-file diffusion is realized.
1	Abstract   By means of direct dynamics methods theoretical investigations are carried out on the multiple-channel reaction system Cl + CH 3 S(O)CH 3 . The optimized geometries, frequencies and minimum energy path (MEP) are all obtained at the BHH and the three-parameter formula  k  = 1.32 × 10 −16   T  2.18 exp(−48.12/ T ) cm 3  molecule −1  s −1  over the temperature region 200–2000 K is given. For the title reaction, CH 3 S(O)CH 2  + HCl is the major product, and CH 3 S(O)Cl + CH 3  is a minor product over the whole temperature region.
0	As part of its geoarchaeological research program, the El Hibeh Project of the University of California, Berkeley field-tested at the site of El Hibeh, northern Middle Egypt, the utility of a portable EDXRF unit for obtaining geochemical analyses of pottery suitable for provenance and other ceramic classification studies. When the geochemical ceramic data from the field test are combined with basic petrographic analysis for the pottery sample set, compelling results are generated. In particular, a triangular scattergram using elemental iron, strontium and rubidium data, in parts per million, provides excellent temporal and spatial separation of ceramic fabrics type, origin and date. The geochemical behavior of iron, strontium and rubidium is discussed in relation to geological source materials utilized for pottery manufacture.
1	To discern the presence of two anatomically close species within an archaeological assemblage is always a problem for the analyst. A particularly interesting case is the distinction between the red fox (Vulpes vulpes) and the arctic fox (Alopex lagopus), which is often determined using non-rigorous criteria and producing results that must be regarded with caution. Classical methods for separating these two species and determining sexual dimorphism, and eventually the sex ratio, such as analyses using uni- and bivariate plots, are based on arbitrarily fixed limits between sexes. In this text, a more robust statistical method termed mixture analysis (MA) is used to determine the species of limb bones from foxes. First, the MA is applied to a sample of each species using metric data taken from a collection of present-day fox skeletons. Afterwards, the MA is applied to archaeological samples dated to the Dorset period and retrieved from the Tayara site (near Salluit, South Hudson Strait, Nunavik). The results clearly demonstrate that the greatest length (GL) of long bones, especially the humerus and tibia, is the best measurement for distinguishing the species, followed by the distal breadth and the proximal breadth; and that GL is better suited for sexing foxes. The results of MA applied to the Tayara site collection lead to the conclusion that the red fox is present along with the arctic fox among the assemblage, and that there is no fox body size change during the last two millennia in the Eastern Arctic.
1	Abstract   This paper discusses the results of a detailed functional study of 16 microlithic backed tools made on quartz, and newly excavated at Sibudu Cave, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. The layers associated with the artefacts have OSL ages of 61.7 ± 1.5 ka, 63.8 ± 2.5 ka and 64.7 ± 1.9 ka and represent the Howiesons Poort Industry at the site. I show that more than 50% of the pieces could hardly have been used in any way other than to tip arrows in a transverse position. This outcome supports previous inferences that some of these small stone tools, and perhaps a bone point from the same context, signify the use of bow and arrow technology during the Middle Stone Age. In addition to transversely hafted arrow tips, there is also evidence that some of the tools could have been hafted diagonally. Such tools could have been used equally successfully as arrow tips or barbs, or as barbs for hand-delivered spears. The variation in hafting configuration for these geometric shapes signifies hunting technologies that were flexible and most likely adapted according to need, preference, season and/or prey type.
0	Abstract   The extraordinary improvements of modern imaging devices offer access to data with unprecedented information content. However, widely used image processing methodologies fall far short of exploiting the full breadth of information offered by numerous types of scanning probe, optical, and electron microscopies. In many applications, it is necessary to keep measurement intensities below a desired threshold. We propose a methodology for extracting an increased level of information by processing a series of data sets suffering, in particular, from high degree of spatial uncertainty caused by complex multiscale motion during the acquisition process. An important role is played by a non-rigid pixel-wise registration method that can cope with low signal-to-noise ratios. This is accompanied by formulating objective quality measures which replace human intervention and visual inspection in the processing chain. Scanning transmission electron microscopy of siliceous zeolite material exhibits the above-mentioned obstructions and therefore serves as orientation and a test of our procedures.
1	Abstract   The vasodilator effect of the ethanolic extract of leaves from Hancornia speciosa Gomes (HSE) was studied in rat aortic rings. HSE produced a concentration-dependent vasodilatation (pIC50 = 5.6 ± 0.1), which was completely abolished in endothelium-denuded vessels. The endothelium-dependent vasodilatation induced by HSE was abolished by  l -NAME (100 μM), a nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitor, but not atropine (1 μM; pIC50 = 5.6 ± 0.2), a muscarinic receptor antagonist, nor indomethacin (10 μM; pIC50 = 5.4 ± 0.2), a cyclooxygenase inhibitor. The concentration–response curve of HSE was significantly shifted to the left by superoxide dismutase (SOD; 300 U/mL). In addition, while SOD displaced the 3-morpholino-sidnonimine (SIN-1; P
1	Abstract   Ethnopharmacological relevance  A recent ethnomedical survey on medicinal plants grown in Mexico revealed that  Sechium edule  (Jacq.) Sw. (Cucurbitaceae) is one of the most valued plant species to treat cardiovascular diseases, including hypertension. Fruits, young leaves, buds, stems, and tuberous roots of the plant are edible. Considering that endothelial dysfunction induced by Angiotensin II plays an important role in the pathogenesis of hypertension and is accompanied by a prooxidative condition, which in turn induces an inflammatory state, vascular remodeling, and tissue damage, and that  S. edule  has been reported to possess antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antihypertensive activity, its capability to control endothelial dysfunction was also assessed.    Aim of the study  To assess  in vivo  the anti-endothelial dysfunction activity of the acetone fraction (rSe-ACE) of the hydroalcoholic extract from  S. edule  roots.    Materials and methods  Endothelial dysfunction was induced in female C57BL/6 J mice by a daily intraperitoneal injection of angiotensin II for 10 weeks. Either rSe-ACE or losartan (as a control) were co-administered with angiotensin II for the same period. Blood pressure was measured at weeks 0, 5, and 10. Kidney extracts were prepared to determine IL1β, IL4, IL6, IL10, IL17, IFNγ, TNFα, and TGFβ levels by ELISA, along with the prooxidative status as assessed by the activity of antioxidant enzymes. The expression of ICAM-1 was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in kidney histological sections. Kidney and hepatic damage, as well as vascular tissue remodeling, were studied.    Results  The rSe-ACE fraction administered at a dose of 10 mg/kg was able to control hypertension, as well as the prooxidative and proinflammatory status in kidney as efficiently as losartan, returning mice to normotensive levels. Additionally, the fraction was more efficient than losartan to prevent liver and kidney damage. Phytochemical characterization identified cinnamic acid as a major compound, and linoleic, palmitic, and myristic acids as the most abundant non-polar components in the mixture, previously reported to aid in the control of hypertension, inflammation, and oxidative stress, three important components of endothelial dysfunction.    In conclusion  this study demonstrated that rSe-ACE has anti-endothelial dysfunction activity in an experimental model and highlights the role of cinnamic acid and fatty acids in the observed effects.
1	The catalytic degradation of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and polypropylene (PP) using a modified ZSM-5 zeolite, DeLaZSM-5, has been investigated. The results obtained have been compared with those of USY, ZSM-5, and also thermal degradation. The degradation behaviours of LDPE and PP using DeLaZSM-5 were quite different from those observed in thermal degradation and in studies using USY as catalysts. LDPE exhibited much higher degradation activity using the DeLaZSM-5 than PP did, especially in relatively lower temperature stage, indicating that DeLaZSM-5 shows a shape-selective effect in catalytic degradation of LDPE and PP. The factors affecting the shape-selective effect of DeLaZSM-5 are discussed. It was concluded that the pore structure and unique acid properties of the DeLaZSM-5 as well as proper reaction temperatures were important factors to fully exert this shape-selective effect.
0	Five oligomeric styrene surfactants, N,N,N-trimethylpolystyrylammonium, N,N-dimethyl-N-benzylpolystyrylammonium, N,N-dimethyl-N-hexadecylpolystyrylammonium, 1,2-dimethyl-3-polystyrylimidazolium, and triphenylpolystyrylphosphonium chlorides were synthesized and used to prepare organically modified clays. Both styrene and methyl methacrylate nanocomposites were prepared by melt blending and the type of nanocomposite was evaluated by X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy. The thermal stability of the organically modified clays and the nanocomposites were studied by thermogravimetric analysis; these systems do give clays which have good thermal stability and may be useful for melt blending with polymers that must be processed at higher temperatures.
1	Abstract   Cage-type octaphenyl silsesquioxane (OPS) and ladder-type polyphenyl silsesquioxane (PPSQ) have been used as flame-retardants in epoxy resins (EPs) in the presence and absence of 9,10-dihydro-9-oxa-10-phosphaphenanthrene-10-oxide (DOPO). The flame retardancy of these EPs have been tested by the LOI and UL-94 standard tests, and details of fire behaviors, such as TTI, HRR, p-HRR, THR, COPR, and CO 2 PR, have been tested using a cone calorimeter. The results have shown that OPS has distinctly different effects on the flame retardancy of EPs compared to those of PPSQ. In the UL-94 test, the flame-retarded EP with OPS showed a weak blowing-out effect, but the flame-retarded EP with PPSQ did not; further, the flame-retarded EP with DOPO/OPS showed a significant blowing-out effect, but the flame-retarded EP with DOPO/PPSQ did not. According to the cone tests, addition of PPSQ to EPs, with or without DOPO, causes higher p-HRR; on the contrary, the addition of OPS to EPs leads to lower p-HRR compared to that of the neat EP. The thermal stability of these EPs has been investigated by TGA. The morphology of the chars after the cone tests has been investigated by visual observation, SEM, and XPS. Observation of the chars suggested that OPS can assist the EP, especially the EP with DOPO, to form stronger and denser chars than PPSQ, although PPSQ with a ladder structure has higher thermal stability than that of cage-type OPS. It was also observed that the Si concentration in the interior chars from the EPs with PPSQ was higher than that in those from the EPs with OPS. It is supposed that in the composites of EP or EP/DOPO, slow charring of PPSQ cannot match the intumescent and charring process of the EPs during combustion, but OPS can. This may explain why OPS exhibits significantly different flame retardancy on the EPs compared to PPSQ.
1	Abstract   A new ruthenium(II) polypyridyl complex [Ru(dmp) 2 (pddppn)](ClO 4 ) 2   Ru1  was synthesized and characterized. The cytotoxic activity in vitro of the complex was evaluated by MTT method.  Ru1  shows high effect on the inhibition of the cell growth against BEL-7402, HeLa, MG-63 and A549 cells with low IC 50  values of 1.6 ± 0.4, 9.0 ± 0.8, 1.5 ± 0.2 and 1.5 ± 0.3 μM, respectively. The cellular uptake indicates that  Ru1  can enter into the cytoplasm and accumulate in the cell nuclei.  Ru1  can induce apoptosis in A549 cells and enhance the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and induce the decrease of mitochondrial membrane potential. In addition,  Ru1  can down-regulate the levels of Bcl-2, Bcl-x, Bak, and Bim expression and up-regulate the expression of Bag-1 and Bad. The complex induces apoptosis of A549 cells through an intrinsic ROS-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction pathway, which was accompanied by regulating the expression of caspases and Bcl-2 family proteins.
1	Abstract   The mechanism of the freak wave formation related to the spatial–temporal focusing is studied within the framework of the Korteweg–de Vries equation. A method to find the wave trains whose evolution leads to the freak wave formation is proposed. It is based on the solution of the Korteweg–de Vries equation with an initial condition corresponding to the expected freak wave. All solutions of this Cauchy problem by the reversal of abscissa represent the possible forms of wave trains which evolve into the freak wave. It is found that freak waves are almost linear waves, and their characteristic Ursell parameter is small. The freak wave formation is possible also from the random wave field and the numerical simulation describes the details of this phenomenon. It is shown that freak waves can be generated not only for specific conditions, but also for relative wide classes of the wave trains. This mechanism explains the rare and short-lived character of the freak wave.
1	A central element of many fundamental problems in physics and biology lies in the interaction of a viscous fluid with slender, elastic filaments. Examples arise in the dynamics of biological fibers, the motility of microscopic organisms, and in phase transitions of liquid crystals. When considering the dynamics on the scale of a single filament, the surrounding fluid can often be assumed to be inertialess and hence governed by the Stokes’ equations. A typical simplification then is to assume a local relation, along the filament, between the force per unit length exerted by the filament upon the fluid and the velocity of the filament. While this assumption can be justified through slender-body theory as the leading-order effect, this approximation is only logarithmically separated (in aspect ratio) from the next-order contribution capturing the first effects of non-local interactions mediated by the surrounding fluid; non-local interactions become increasingly important as a filament comes within proximity to itself, or another filament. Motivated by a pattern forming system in isotropic to smectic-A phase transitions, we consider the non-local Stokesian dynamics of a growing elastica immersed in a fluid. The non-local interactions of the filament with itself are included using a modification of the slender-body theory of Keller and Rubinow. This modification is asymptotically equivalent, and removes an instability of their formulation at small, unphysical length-scales. Within this system, the filament lives on a marginal stability boundary, driven by a continual process of growth and buckling. Repeated bucklings result in filament flex, which, coupled to the non-local interactions and mediated by elastic response, leads to the development of space-filling patterns. We develop numerical methods to solve this system accurately and efficiently, even in the presence of temporal stiffness and the close self-approach of the filament. While we have ignored many of the thermodynamic aspects of this system, our simulations show good qualitative agreement with experimental observations. Our results also suggest that non-locality, induced by the surrounding fluid, will be important to understanding the dynamics of related filament systems. © 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

1	Abstract   Thymidine analogue resistance mutations (TAMs) in HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) associate in two clusters: (i) TAM1 (M41L, L210W and T215Y) and TAM2 (D67N, K70R, K219E/Q, and sometimes T215F). The amino acid substitution H208Y shows increased prevalence in patients treated with nucleoside analogues and is frequently associated with TAM1 mutations. We studied the molecular mechanism favoring the selection of H208Y in the presence of zidovudine, tenofovir and other nucleoside RT inhibitors (NRTIs). NRTI susceptibility was not affected by the addition of H208Y in phenotypic assays carried out in MT-4 cells using recombinant HIV-1 containing wild-type (subtype B, BH10), H208Y, M41L/L210W/T215Y or M41L/H208Y/L210W/T215Y RTs. However, enzymatic studies carried out with purified RTs revealed that in the presence of M41L/L210W/T215Y, H208Y increases the RT’s ability to unblock and extend primers terminated with zidovudine, tenofovir and in a lesser extent, stavudine. These effects were observed with DNA/DNA complexes (but not with RNA/DNA) and resulted from the higher ATP-dependent excision activity of the M41L/H208Y/L210W/T215Y RT compared with the M41L/L210W/T215Y mutant. The increased rescue efficiency of the M41L/H208Y/L210W/T215Y RT was observed in the presence of ATP but not with GTP or ITP. Molecular dynamics studies predict an alteration of the stacking interactions between Tyr215 and the adenine ring of ATP due to long-distance effects caused by tighter packaging of Tyr208 and Trp212. These studies provide a mechanistic explanation for the association of TAM-1 and H208Y mutations in viral isolates from patients treated with NRTIs.
1	Abstract   Early events in herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) infection reactivate latent human immunodeficiency virus, Epstein–Barr virus, and human papillomavirus in the presence of acyclovir (ACV). The common use of nucleoside analog medications, such as ACV and pencyclovir, has resulted in the emergence of drug-resistant HSV-1 strains in clinical therapy. Therefore, new antiherpetics that can inhibit early events in HSV-1 infection should be developed. An example of this treatment is Houttuynia cordata Thunb. water extract, which can inhibit HSV-1 infection through multiple mechanisms. In this study, the anti-HSV-1 activity of Houttuynoid A, a new type of flavonoid isolated from H. cordata, was investigated. Three different assays confirmed that this compound could exhibit strong in vitro anti-HSV-1 activity. One assay verified that this compound could inhibit HSV-1 multiplication and prevent lesion formation in a HSV-1 infection mouse model. Mechanism analysis revealed that this compound could inactivate HSV-1 infectivity by blocking viral membrane fusion. Moreover, Houttuynoid A exhibited antiviral activities against other alpha herpes viruses, such as HSV-2 and varicella zoster virus (VZV). In conclusion, Houttuynoid A may be a useful antiviral agent for HSV-1.
0	Abstract   Ionic reactions in bulk solution generally occur relatively slowly, and the course of reaction can be followed by on-line monitoring using, for example, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (MS). In another approach, ionic reactions occurring in confined volumes can be studied with a focus on increasing reaction rates upon reduction in solution volume (e.g., by solvent evaporation from small droplets). Such a situation is encountered in ambient ionization MS, which involves the ionization of samples in their native state without significant sample preparation. Reagents can be included in the spray solvents used in ambient ionization and rapid derivatization reactions can accompany ionization. These latter experiments form the topic of this review. Emphasis is on their value in chemical analysis, but the products of these reactions can also be collected easily and form the basis for small-scale synthesis.
0	New complexes of Cd(II), Zn(II) and Ni(II) with 2-quinolinecarboxaldehyde selenosemicarbazone (Hqasesc) were synthesized and structurally characterized. The structure of the ligand, Cd(II) and Zn(II) complexes was determined by NMR and IR spectroscopy, elemental microanalysis and molar conductivity measurements. Both complexes occur in solution in two forms, the major tetrahedral and minor octahedral. In the major Cd(II) complex one qasesc ligand is coordinated as a tridentate, the fourth coordination site being occupied by acetate, while in the major Zn(II) complex two qasesc ligands are coordinated as bidentates. In both minor complexes two qasesc ligands are coordinated as tridentates forming the octahedral geometry around the central metal ion. The only paramagnetic complex in the series is Ni(II) complex for which X-ray structure analysis was performed. The complex has the angularly distorted octahedral geometry with two qasesc ligands coordinated as tridentates, in a similar way as in the minor complexes of Cd(II) and Zn(II). � 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

0	Abstract   Solution chemistry methods were developed, resulting in the controllable formation of complexes [(bath)2Eu2(piv)6]·2EtOH (1a·2EtOH), [(bath)2Eu2(piv)6]·1.5EtOH (1b·1.5EtOH), and [(bath)2Eu2(piv)6]·0.75H2O (1c·0.75H2O), where piv is (CH3)3CCO2− and bath is 4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline. Polymorphs 1a, 1b, and 1c of the composition [(bath)2Eu2(piv)6] are produced by desolvation of the appropriate solvates. 1a·2EtOH, 1b·1.5EtOH, 1c·0.75H2O, 1a, 1b, and 1c were characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SC-XRD). 1a·2EtOH, 1b·1.5EtOH, and 1c·0.75H2O differ in the structural functions of µ2-piv anions and have different molecular and crystal structures. 1a·2EtOH contains two μ2-piv-κ2O,O′ anions and two μ2-piv-κ2O,O,O′ anions, whereas 1b·1.5EtOH and 1c·0.75H2O have four μ2-piv-κ2O,O′ anions. Single crystals of 1b·1.5EtOH (monoclinic, C2/c) and 1c·0.75H2O (monoclinic, I2/a) undergo reversible desolvation–solvation without structural changes. The unique feature of 1b and 1c is melting at high temperatures. The melting of 1b and its subsequent crystallization lead to the polymorphic transition from 1b to 1c. The latter is reversibly melt-crystallized. The unique feature of 1a·2EtOH is that it undergoes two 0D–0D single-crystal-to-single crystal (SCSC) transitions. The SCSC transition from 1a·2EtOH (triclinic,     P    1    ¯      ) to 1a (monoclinic, P21) is a result of desolvation is accompanied by a change in the crystal system. The most significant change during the temperature-induced SCSC polymorphic transition from 1a to 1c (monoclinic, I2/a) is the Eu–O bond cleavage resulting in different coordination geometries of Eu atoms in 1a and 1c. The overall quantum yield       Q    Ln    L       for 1a·2EtOH amounts to 62%. A comparison of the spectroscopic and photophysical data for the Eu complexes shows that the differences in the coordination geometries of the metal atoms in the Eu pivalates have no effect on intensity of Eu3+ ion luminescence. The results of the present study demonstrate that all complexes hold promise for the design of brightly emissive Eu3+-containing materials.
0	Abstract   We developed and tested a numerical scheme for solving a systematically discretized version of the Born-Green-Yvon equation. We collected histograms for the two- and three-body distribution functions from Monte Carlo simulations of the Lennard-Jones liquid. The discretized pair-potential were obtained by solving a set of linear equations where the number of unknowns was given by the number of bins of the pair-correlation function. Using this scheme we were able to recover the Lennard-Jones pair-potential of the simulations with good accuracy. We found that the technique is not very sensitive for the statistics of the correlation functions but requires small bin size. We applied the method for three-particle correlation functions calculated from Reverse Monte Carlo (RMC) simulations to test the performance of different possible RMC algorithms.
0	Abstract   The paper reports study of the complexation processes in aqueous solutions of α-cyclodextrin and iodide ions. The speed and absorption of ultrasonic waves have been measured by the resonance method on a Resoscan™ System apparatus. Density and capacity of the system have been also measured. All measurements have been performed at the constant temperature T = 298.15 K. On the basis of these data, thermodynamical parameters — such as molar volume, molar adiabatic compressibility and their excess functions, have been calculated. To be able to express the concentration of the ternary solution in mole fraction, the initial solutions of the water/α-CD ratio of 550/1 (∼ 0.1 mol/l) and of the water/KI (or water/(KI + 0,77 I2)) at the same ratio, have been prepared. The composition of molecular complexes formed in the solution has been determined on the basis of the correlation between the extremes of the excess functions and ultrasonic absorption for different compositions of the mixtures. The results obtained have suggested formation of inclusion complexes between α-cyclodextrin and iodide ions of the specific stoichiometric compositions: (α-CD)2 I3−I2, (α-CD) I3−I2 and (α-CD)2 I−.
0	Abstract   Fe4(P2O7)3 was successfully synthesized by using high temperature solid state reaction method and characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). The as-synthesized Fe4(P2O7)3 was applied as adsorbent to adsorb U(VI) ions from aqueous solutions and the material exhibited high sorption capacity for U(VI). The effect of contact time, pH, ionic strength, solid content and temperature on U(VI) sorption to Fe4(P2O7)3 was investigated by using batch technique. The results demonstrated that the sorption of U(VI) was independent of ionic strength, indicating that the sorption was mainly dominated by inner-sphere surface complexation. The thermo-dynamic parameters (ΔG0, ΔS0 and ΔH0) were calculated from the temperature-dependent sorption isotherms, and the results suggested that the sorption of U(VI) was a spontaneous and endothermic process. To get a better understanding of the interaction mechanism between U(VI) and Fe4(P2O7)3, the U(VI) adsorbed Fe4(P2O7)3 was characterized by SEM, XRD and FT-IR. The results might be important for the application of Fe4(P2O7)3 in the field of U(VI) pollution management.
0	Abstract   New solubility data for difluoromethane (R32), 1,1,1,3,3-pentafluoropropane (R245fa), 1,1,2,2,3,3,3-heptafluoropropane (R227ea) and 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoropropane (R236fa) in trihexyltetradecylphosphonium bis(2,4,4-trimethylpentyl)phosphinate ([P14666][TMPP]) at temperatures from 292 K to 344 K and at pressures from 0.01 MPa to 1.07 MPa is presented in this work. Low temperature and high pressure can improve the solubilities of hydrofluorocarbons in [P14666][TMPP]. Hydrofluorocarbons are more soluble in [P14666][TMPP] than their corresponding alkanes. Dispersive force, dipole–dipole interaction and hydrogen bond interaction were considered to exist between HFC and [P14666][TMPP]. A modified Krichevsky-Kasarnovsky equation was used to correlate the solubilities of R32, R227ea, R236fa and R245fa in [P14666][TMPP] with the mean absolute relative deviations and the maximum absolute relative deviations less than 2.0% and 4.3%, respectively.
0	Abstract   Nuclear track detectors were used to measure the longitudinal and transverse distributions of slow neutrons in a moderated neutron field as well as the longitudinal and transverse distributions of fast neutrons produced on the 0° beam line of the KFUPM 350 keV ion accelerator. The neutrons were first produced from the T(d,n)4He reaction with a neutron energy of approximately 14 MeV and were then moderated in a cylindrical polyethylene moderator placed at the end of the 0° beam line. The optimal transverse slow neutron distribution was found to be uniform within ±4.5% at a 3 cm depth inside the moderator. The fast neutron distribution component along the moderator central axis exhibited an exponential-like drop in intensity with depth. Linearity checks of alpha and proton recoil track density with irradiation time for the nuclear track detectors were verified for both slow and fast neutrons.
1	Abstract   Arctic char, Salvelinus alpinus, exhibit either lake resident or anadromous (sea-run) life histories. Anadromy is less prevalent at the northern and southern extremes of the distribution. Effective conservation and management of char requires knowledge of life histories exhibited by individuals and populations. Micro-PIXE line-scans were used to determine the distribution of strontium (Sr) in otoliths from which life history patterns were determined for Arctic char from 10 lakes in Quttinirpaaq National Park in the Canadian High Arctic. Although most populations were lake resident as expected, the data indicated that a component of the char population from one lake was anadromous. This represents the most northerly known char population to exhibit anadromy. Mean Sr concentrations in otoliths of char from all populations, as determined by point analysis and also from line-scan data, showed no significant differences between the methods. Mean Sr concentrations (from point analysis) showed significant differences between some of the populations. These differences combined with other analyses (e.g. morphometrics, genetics) can be used to differentiate biological populations. Thus, micro-PIXE analysis is a useful tool for assessing diversity in Arctic char and contributing to their management and conservation in the park.
0	Isotope yields at ISOLDE are regularly measured online (with dedicated gamma and beta detectors) and off line by implantation and subsequent alpha-, beta- or gamma spectroscopy. The Java based measurement software, dedicated to tape station measurements, has been updated in order to automate yield measurements and provide possibilities to repeat existing measurements. A procedure supported by dedicated programs was established to analyze data. The results are centrally stored and provide an interface to the existing ISOLDE yield database. The present ISOLDE yield database has been recently created and updated with a large number of yields compiled from published data. The database developed on ORACLE guarantees reliability and security and provides a simple way of compiling new information. A user oriented interface has been programmed allowing accessing the information via a web browser. Several levels in the database structure provide selective access to different layers of technical information for advanced users and for technical R&amp;D. The improvements in the yield measurement procedure, the data storage and accessibility, as well as the new database structure, the web application and the access interfaces, enhance the communication between technical information like yields and the users of the ISOLDE facility.
0	Abstract   The electromagnetic radiation emitted by 120 GeV/c volume-reflected electrons in a bent silicon crystal has been investigated at CERN SPS-H4 beamline. The trajectories of electrons crossing a silicon strip-like crystal have been reconstructed through a telescope system based on high precision micro-strip detectors. The experimental setup was also equipped with a spectrometer and an electromagnetic calorimeter to measure the energy loss of the particles under volume reflection condition. Such a system enabled to record the full photon spectrum up to the nominal energy of the beam. Experimental results were compared to recently developed theoretical approaches based on the quasi-classical operators method of Baier and Katkov.
1	Abstract   The formation of reactive species and free radicals in water soluble elastin hydrolysates have been investigated by pulse radiolysis and flash photolysis. Elastin hydrolysates were obtained by hydrolysis of elastin extracted from aorta.  An investigation of the photochemical properties of elastin hydrolysates in water was carried out using nanosecond laser irradiation. The transient spectra of elastin hydrolysates solution excited at 266 nm showed two bands. One of them with maximum at 295 nm and the second one with maximum at 400 nm.  The reactions of hydrated electrons and  OH radicals with elastin have been studied by pulse radiolysis. In the absorption spectra of products resulting from the reaction of elastin with       e    aq    -       small maximum absorption in UV and visible light was observed. In the absorption spectra of products resulting from the reaction of the hydroxyl radicals with elastin two bands were observed. The first one at 320 nm and the second one at 410 nm. Reaction of  OH radicals with elastin hydrolysates lead to formation of Tyr phenoxyl radicals with absorption at 410 nm. The influence of the addition of sodium azide NaN3 on the formation of the transients was evaluated.
0	Abstract   Synchronous fluorescence spectroscopy is an efficient technique for decoupling fluorophores which are masked in fluorescence spectroscopy due to overlapping of dominant fluorophores. By choosing appropriate offsets between excitation and emission wavelengths during signal acquisition from turbid samples, responses of individual fluorophores are highlighted as sharp peaks by using this technique. Some of the peaks may, however, still be missed due to wavelength dependent absorption and scattering effects. In this study a correction technique is used to extract such hidden signatures. The technique is validated using tissue phantoms with known concentrations of fluorophores, absorbers and scatterers. On the basis of validation studies on single and combination of two fluorophores, it is found that lower offsets display better recovery due to minimal influence of absorption by blood. Among the different offsets, 55 nm is found to be optimal for investigation of cervical precancers.
1	Abstract   Biocompatibility of nanoparticles depends on their binding behavior with biomolecules. Herein, we have reported the interaction of three different biological macromolecules such as hemoglobin, gamma globulin and transferrin with hydroxyl group functionalized Multi-Walled Carbon Nanotubes (OH-MWCNTs). Multiple spectroscopic methods were utilized to identify the binding cum structural changes in biomolecules upon their interaction. Hyperchromic effect observed in the UV–visible spectra, and the quenching behavior from fluorescence emission evidences the existence of bio-nanotube complex formation. Synchronous and three-dimensional fluorescence spectra of biomolecules, in correspondence with Trp and Tyr residues showed the possible disturbance towards their aromatic micro-environment. Changes observed in the FTIR and FT-Raman amide bands, and amino acid residue position of biomolecules upon interaction with CNTs showed the possible effect towards their secondary structure. Further studies with CD spectroscopy indicated the loss of alpha-helical structures quantitatively. The study remains significant in evaluating the biosafety profile of functionalized MWCNTs for their in vivo biomedical applications.
0	Thermally detected optical absorption (TDOA) and photoluminescence (PL) experiments were performed at 0.35 and 4 K, respectively, on InxGa1-xN (0 &lt; x &lt; 0.12) layers grown on GaN-coated sapphire substrates by molecular beam epitaxy. By modelling the absorption spectra of (In,Ga)N and GaN it is possible to deduce the bandgap energy and absorption coefficient of the alloy. With the complex GaN refractive index, measured by ellipsometry, the inferences that appear in the TDOA spectra can be modelled. An approach is proposed to remove these oscillations which are also present in the PL spectra. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.
0	Abstract   A feasibility study has been conducted to determine whether soldering process can be used for the joining of metallic glasses. The mechanical properties of metallic glasses are extremely attractive compared with conventional crystalline materials. In order to adopt bulk metallic glasses in a broader range of engineering applications, it is very important to establish appropriate joining processes of metallic glasses. During the joint of metallic glass, the most serious issue is the reformation of glassy phase at the high temperature area. Therefore, to avoid the recrystallization of glassy phase, the soldering process has been investigated to join metallic glasses. In this study, the spread test was mainly performed at 523 K for 60 s. Results showed that the Sn–3.0 mass%Ag–0.5 mass%Cu solder deposited on Pd-based metallic glass had better wetting characteristics than the Sn–57 mass%Bi and Sn–51 mass%In solders. The microstructure at the interface between Sn–3.0Ag–0.5Cu solder and Pd-based metallic glass was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy. It was clear that the intermetallic compound, PdSn 4  phase, was formed at the interface.
0	Abstract   Electronic noses are object of research since more than two decades; nonetheless, the analogies between natural and olfaction systems are still limited to the selectivity properties of the receptors. The implementation of more sophisticated features such as the large number of receptors and the glomeruli layer have been hampered by technical difficulties related to the management of a large number of contemporaneous signals. As demonstrated in the past, optical imaging is a read-out technique for sensors development that can provide large sensor arrays. In this paper an artificial olfaction system based on the imaging of a continuous layer of chemical indicators is illustrated. The system incorporates an array of thousands of sensors, corresponding to the pixels of the image. The choice of Computer Screen Photoassisted Technology as a platform for optical interrogation of the sensing layer allows for the definition of a strategy for an automatic definition of a glomeruli layer based on the classification of the optical fingerprints of the image pixels. Chemical indicators were dissolved into a polymeric matrix providing the further property of odor diffusion mimicking the functions of the olfactory mucosa. The system has been tested in a simple experiment and data have been treated applying a lateral inhibition to the glomeruli layer resulting in a dynamic pattern resembling that observed in natural olfaction.
1	Abstract   Within this article, we report the characterization and organic vapor sensing properties of Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) thin films of calix[8]arenes. Surface pressure–area isotherms show that very stable monolayers are formed at the air–water interface. The LB film could be deposited onto different substrates which allowed the films to be characterized by UV, quartz crystal microbalance (QCM), surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The results indicate that good quality, uniform LB films can be prepared with transfer ratios of over 0.95. QCM results showed that the deposited mass of calix[8]arene monolayer onto a quartz crystal decreased from 693 to 204 ng as the number of layers is increased. AFM studies showed a smooth, and void free surface morphology with a rms value of 1.202 nm. The sensing abilities of this LB film towards the development of room temperature organic vapor sensing devices are also studied. Responses of the LB films to various vapors are fast, large, and reversible. It was found that the obtained LB film is significantly more sensitive to chloroform than other vapors. It can be concluded that this molecule could have a potential application in the research area of room temperature vapor sensing devices.
1	Abstract   LaCoxFe1−xO3 nanoparticles (x = 0, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3) are prepared by a sol–gel method, and the effects of calcination temperature, Co-doping, and carbon nanotube (CNT)-treatment on their ethanol sensing properties are investigated. The highest response is found based on the LaCo0.1Fe0.9O3 nanoparticles calcined at 600 °C, and the sensing properties of this sample can be further improved by adding CNT in the precursor. The responses of un-treated and CNT-treated LaCo0.1Fe0.9O3 nanoparticles are about 120.1 and 137.3–500 ppm ethanol at 140 °C, respectively. Simultaneously, by CNT -treatment, the response time is decreased from 56 to 10 s, and the recovery time is decreased from 95 to 35 s. The results not only make LaCo0.1Fe0.9O3 nanoparticles good candidates for fabricating practical gas sensors, but also provide a possible route for employing CNTs as a pore-forming agent.
1	Abstract   A DNA-based assay for the detection of one-point mutation in  TP53  gene, responsible for lung cancer, was developed using a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) biosensor systems. Amine coupling was employed for the immobilization of NeutrAvidin on thiol-derivatized surface to capture the biotinylated target sequence. Two targets sequences and one control DNA sequence were investigated including, a fully complementary (30 mer), one-point mutation and a non-complimentary DNA using hybridization with a detection probe strand (27 mer). The most appropriate surface coating was also examined for both sensor platforms with hybridization and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) detection efficiency were then compare. A 0.03–2 μM concentration range of detection probe was detected using the SPR and QCM sensors on wild and mutant type target surfaces. The linear regression analysis was performed for both sensors resulting in a  R  2  value for the SPR assay of 0.985 and 0.993 for perfect and mismatch reaction and of 0.978 and 0.976 for the QCM assay, respectively. The obtained results demonstrate that the used approach represents a very promising future method for the detection of one-point mutation in genetic-based health problem with highly sensitive, specific, and real-time analysis.
0	Abstract   In this research, we reported a method for synthesis of NaA zeolite. NaA zeolite has been successfully prepared within 30 min by microwave heating without using any conventional hydrothermal treatment and due to the exchange process the silver-loaded NaA microsized zeolites was produced. The synthesized zeolite was characterized using X-ray diffraction, scanning electronic microscopy and FT-IR techniques. The modified carbon paste electrode was prepared by incorporation of Ag(I) zeolite in the carbon paste matrix. Differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) was employed for development of electrochemical DNA hybridization biosensors based on Ag/NaA zeolite modified carbon paste electrode (Ag/ZMCPE) and methylene blue (MB) as electroactive label was used. The sensors rely on immobilization of a 15-mer single stranded oligonucleotide probe for detection of target DNA, as a model. The hybridization event was evaluated by DPV. Moreover, Ag/ZMCPE showed better advantages than NaA zeolite modified carbon paste electrode (ZMCPE). Under optimized experimental conditions, limit of detection was calculated 4.00 × 10−12 M.
1	Abstract   A quadruple-channel visual colorimetric sensor array has been developed to discriminate serum antioxidants. The redox reaction between 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) and sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) can successively generate colorful products with strong absorption at different wavelengths. The presence of five antioxidants containing glutathione, cysteine, lipoic acid, melatonin, and uric acid disrupts the redox reaction between TMB and NaClO, giving birth to distinct colorimetric response patterns. By taking advantage of principal component analysis, the five antioxidants are identified with an accuracy of 100%. The sensor array is capable of visually discriminating different concentrations of the same antioxidant and binary mixtures of two antioxidants as well as working well in real fetal bovine serum. The distinguishable lowest concentration of antioxidants using this sensor array is 1 μM, which is about one or three orders of magnitude lower than that of the recently reported colorimetric sensor array.
1	Abstract   In this work, a microfluidic paper-based fluorescent sensor device was constructed for quantitative detection of microRNA (miRNA) and determination of the expression of folate receptor (FR) on the cell surface. It is worth pointing out that simultaneous detection of two biomarkers in cancer was achieved through dynamic self-assembly of T-shaped duplex structure. T-shaped duplex structure can respond to specific triggers and convert to an output due to the conformation changes, it is meaningful to fabricate T-shaped duplex structure into powerful biosensors that can monitor chemical stimuli. Moreover, lamellar MnO2 nanosheets were synthesized, which exhibited excellent quenching ability via adsorbed fluorophore-labeled ssDNA, but the adsorption of the dsDNA was significantly lower than ssDNA because of the shielding of nucleobase pairs by the phosphate groups. This newly designed biosensor provided a sensitive detection of miR-21 from 0.01 to 5.0 fM with a relatively low detection limit of 0.0033 fM. Besides, the present sensing system has a detection of FR in the range from 2.0 to 30.0 ng/mL with the detection limit of 0.667 ng/mL. As biological markers for disease diagnosis, the detection of FR and miRNA will provide a new approach and therapeutic tool for early clinical diagnosis.
0	Abstract   Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) and hemoglobin (Hb) were co-electrospun to generate SWNTs–Hb microbelts, a novel composite material combining the advantages of excellent electron transfer property of SWNTs, electrocatalytic capability of redox Hb proteins, and highly porous structure of microbelts. FT-IR spectra confirmed that Hb in the microbelts kept its native conformational structure and Raman spectra demonstrated the successful incorporation of SWNTs in the microbelts. The direct electrochemistry of SWNTs–Hb composite microbelts was investigated and its application for electrocatalytic reductions and sensitive detections of three compounds, trichloroacetic acid (TCA), nitrite, and hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) was also conducted. The SWNTs–Hb composite microbelts based amperometric biosensor showed fast responses to the analytes with excellent detection limits of 2.41 μM for TCA, 0.30 μM for nitrite, and 0.22 μM for H 2 O 2  (S/N = 3), and superior apparent Michaelis–Menten constants of 0.24, 0.491 and 0.070 mM for TCA, nitrite and H 2 O 2 , respectively. Its application for spiked tap water was also demonstrated. The comparison of the SWNTs–Hb composite microbelts modified electrode with other reported electrodes in the literature indicates that the incorporation of SWNTs into Hb microbelts can significantly enhance the direct electrochemistry of Hb and the SWNTs–Hb microbelts based biosensor has great potential application in the mediator-free detection of various analytes.
1	Abstract   We developed a photonic force microscope that can map multiple parameters simultaneously, including the surface topography and biomolecular interactions. To track the position of the probe bead and to determine contact position with the sample surface, we adopted a video analysis method using the diffraction pattern of monochromatic light passing through the probe bead. To demonstrate the capability of the microscope, we report the simultaneous measurement of the molecule distribution of DNA oligonucleotides on the surface, the binding strength of DNA hybridization between the bead and surface, and the topography of the smooth molded surface.
0	Abstract   A novel sensitive electrochemical DNA biosensor was developed for amperometric detection of  Escherichia coli  O157:H7 ( E. coli  O157:H7). The graphene oxide (GOx) was utilized as nanocarrier to immobilize thionine (Thi) and the Au nanoparticles coated SiO 2  nanocomposites (Au–SiO 2 ) by electrostatic adsorption and the adsorption among nanomaterials. Then a large amounts of signal DNA (S2) and G-quadruplex were immobilized on the GOx–Thi–Au@SiO 2  nanocomposites. Finally, hemin was intercalated into the G-quadruplex to obtain the hemin/G-quadruplex structure as HRP-mimicking DNAzyme. On the basis of the signal amplification strategy of GOx–Thi–Au@SiO 2  nanocomposites and DNAzyme, the developed DNA biosensor could respond to 0.01 nM (S/N=3) with a linear calibration range from 0.02 to 50.0 nM  E. coli  O157:H7, which could be well accepted for early clinical detection. The studied system provides new opportunities, and might speed up disease diagnosis, treatment and prevention with pathogen.
0	Abstract   The influence of early stage growth structure of indium tin oxide (ITO) thin films, deposited by reactive thermal evaporation (RTE) on optical and electrical properties, was studied by atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements. ITO thin films were deposited at  T  s =440 K from an In:Sn alloy in the presence of added oxygen with (series  A ), and without (series  B ) a shutter between the substrate and the crucible. In series  A , the presence of crystallisation seeds smaller than 20 nm was observed in the initial stages of growth. The mean grain size value and the number of grains per aggregate increased with film thickness reaching, respectively, 50 nm and 8 for  t =100 nm. In series  B , the initial stages show the presence of individual features with characteristics dimensions of up to 100 nm scattered on the surface. With increasing thickness ITO thin films of series  B  appear to grow similarly to series  A . In series  A , both transmittance and sheet-resistance were improved.
0	Abstract   This paper describes a novel single-pot synthesis process based on sol–gel for the production of a highly transparent hybrid matrix containing CdS nanoparticles (NPs). The reaction between cadmium and sulphide ions in the presence of 3-mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane (MPTMS) that originates the formation of quantum confined CdS NPs occurs simultaneously with the condensation and polymerization of the gel precursors that evolves to a macromolecular hybrid organic–inorganic network. The obtained xerogel matrix is based on the reaction of organically modified alkoxysilane (3-isocyanatepropyltriethoxysilane) and a di-amine functionalized oligopolyoxyethylene (Jeffamine ED-600). The final material is characterized as highly transparent, homogeneous and flexible xerogel incorporating stabilized and high crystalline CdS NPs that exhibit size-dependent optical properties due to quantum confinement of photogenerated e-h pairs as observed from UV–visible and photoluminescence spectroscopy and HRTEM microscopy measurements. The developed approach has obvious advantages comparatively to the alternative and more complex routes of production of composite materials with embedded semiconductor NPs because of the simplified one-pot preparative procedure used. The developed sol–gel process allows the control of the optical characteristics of the obtained CdS NPs embedded within the network by adjusting the molar ratio between cadmium ion and MPTMS and between cadmium and sulphide ions.
1	Organic push–pull chromophoric system containing thiazole Schiff bases were synthesized from aminothiazole intermediate. These novel chromophores possessed excellent thermal and optical properties with complete transparency in the visible spectral region. Thermogravimetric analysis revealed that all dyes were thermally stable at temperatures above 300 C. The third-order nonlinear optical studies, performed using the Z-scan technique with � 2 ps pulses, revealed excellent three photon absorption coefficients/cross-sections combined with reasonably high values of nonlinear refractive index (n2). The solute n2 was of opposite sign compared to that of solvents. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of three-photon absorption studies in Schiff base compounds.
0	Abstract   The 2H NMR magic-angle spinning (MAS) technique is compared to the static-powder quadrupole echo (QE) and Jeener–Brockaert (JB) pulse sequences for a quantitative investigation of molecular dynamics in solids. The linewidth of individual spinning sidebands of the one-dimensional MAS spectra are observed to be characteristic of the correlation time from ∼10−2 to ∼10−8 s so that the dynamic range is increased by approximately three orders of magnitude when compared to the QE experiment. As a consequence, MAS 2H NMR is found to be more sensitive to the presence of an inhomogeneous distribution of correlation times than the QE and JB experiments which rely upon lineshape distortions due to anisotropic T2 and T1Q relaxation, respectively. All these results are demonstrated experimentally and numerically using the two-site flip motion of dimethyl sulfone and of the nitrobenzene guest in the α-p-tert-butylcalix[4]arene-nitrobenzene inclusion compound.
0	Abstract   A novel blue InGaN-chip-based red-emitting phosphor Pr3+: LaBMO6 (M = W, Mo) in pure phase were synthesized via conventional solid-state reaction in air and the photoluminescence properties of the phosphor were investigated for the application in white LEDs. The as-synthesized phosphors were characterized by the X-ray diffraction; diffuse reflection spectra, photoluminescence excitation and emission spectra, the Commission International de L'Eclairage (CIE) chromaticity coordinates and temperature-dependent emission spectra. Orangish red emission band around 575–625 nm was observed in Pr3+-doped LaBMO6 (M = W, Mo) upon 445 nm excitation. Fluorescence concentration quenching in Pr3+-doped LaBMoO6 were observed and the critical distance between Pr3+ ions for energy transfer was calculated to be 8.369 nm. The CIE chromaticity coordinates of Pr3+-doped LaBMoO6 were located in the red spectral region and the temperature-dependent luminescence spectra indicated that Pr3+-doped LaBMoO6 show good thermal stability. All results demonstrated the developed Pr3+-doped LaBMO6 (M = W, Mo) was a novel red phosphor.
1	Adenosines bearing 5′-modification in conjunction with an N 6 -substituent have previously been shown to act as partial agonists at the A 1  adenosine receptor. Our current work investigates the effect of modifying the 5′-position in conjunction with efficacious bicyclic and tricyclic N 6 -substituents. Several highly potent agonists for the A 1  adenosine receptor were identified; however, all of these compounds behaved as full agonists. In keeping with previous reports, 5′-halogen and 5′-sulfide derivatives of  N  6 -( endo -norborn-2-yl)adenosine were, in general, low nanomolar agonists of the A 1  adenosine receptor. The known partial agonist,  N  6 -cyclopentyl-5′-deoxy-5′-ethylthioadenosine ( 2 ), also behaved as a full agonist in our assay.
0	Abstract   We review recent progress in light sensors based on solution-processed materials. Spin-coated semiconductors can readily be integrated with many substrates including as a post-process atop CMOS silicon and flexible electronics. We focus in particular on visible-, near-infrared, and short-wavelength infrared photodetectors based on size-effect-tuned semiconductor nanoparticles made using quantum-confined PbS, PbSe, Bi2S3, and In2S3. These devices have in recent years achieved room-temperature D* values above 1013 Jones, while fully-depleted photodiodes based on these same materials have achieved MHz response combined with 1012 Jones sensitivities. We discuss the nanoparticle synthesis, the materials processing, integrability, temperature stability, physical operation, and applied performance of this class of devices.
0	Abstract   The addition of nitrogen to III–V alloys has been widely studied as a method of modifying the band gap for mid-infrared (IR) applications. Lattice matching these alloys to convenient substrates such as GaSb, however, is challenging due to the significantly different lattice constants. One approach is to use InGaSbN/InAs grown on GaSb where the InGaSbN layer has a larger lattice constant than the substrate, and the InAs layer has a lower lattice constant, and thus the compressive and tensile stress of the superlattice layers can be balanced in a so called strained-layer superlattice. In this paper, we report InxGa1−xSb1−yNy/InAs strained-layer superlattices with type-II (staggered) energy offsets on GaSb substrates, where the design of the layer thickness is based on the lattice constants and the elastic moduli. Three different strain balance conditions are reported: fixed superlattice period thickness, fixed InAs well thickness, and fixed InxGa1−xSb1−yNy barrier thickness. Eight-band k · p simulations of these structures were used to analyze the superlattice miniband energies. For fully strain balanced InxGa1−xSb1−yNy/InAs superlattices lattice matched to the GaSb substrate, careful consideration of strain balance conditions was needed to achieve a lower effective miniband gap needed for longer cutoff wavelength detectors. For non-strained balanced InxGa1−xSb1−yNy/InAs superlattices, long-wavelength cutoff up to 8 μm can be achieved as part of a trade-off between the deleterious effects of strain and the reduction of the barrier band gap through N incorporation.
0	Abstract   This work presents a quantitative structure–property relationship (QSPR)-based approach allowing an accurate prediction of the excited-state properties of organic dyes (anthraquinones and azobenzenes) from ground-state molecular descriptors, obtained within the (conceptual) density functional theory (DFT) framework. The ab initio computation of the descriptors was achieved at several levels of theory, so that the influence of the basis set size as well as of the modeling of environmental effects could be statistically quantified. It turns out that, for the entire data set, a statistically-robust four-variable multiple linear regression based on PCM-PBE0/6-31G calculations delivers a      R   adj   2      of 0.93 associated to predictive errors allowing for rapid and efficient dye design. All the selected descriptors are independent of the dye's family, an advantage over previously designed QSPR schemes. On top of that, the obtained accuracy is comparable to the one of the today's reference methods while exceeding the one of hardness-based fittings. QSPR relationships specific to both families of dyes have also been built up. This work paves the way towards reliable and computationally affordable color design for organic dyes.
1	Abstract   Deaccessioning – as practice entailing a physical relocation of an item with the consequence of making the item less accessible to its previous audience – is among the most controversial aspects of museum management. The disposal of items has traditionally been considered a violation of the museum's commitment to preservation and display, but a number of arguments have been advanced to point out its contribution to sustainability, efficiency, and even visitor welfare. As a result, deaccessioning has enjoyed increasing recognition both in academia and the professional world. Nevertheless, the consequences of abusing deaccessioning policies seem dire. Excessively liberal disposal policies may cause the dispersion of cultural heritage as well as managerial misconduct due to moral hazard. We review the arguments typically advanced in support and against deaccessioning and argue that, while considerable damage may result from its abuse, the benefits are compelling and regulations may be effectively employed to prevent pitfalls. In addition, we address the current situation of deaccessioning in Europe and argue that, while the subsidiary principle prevents the European Union from ruling in matters of national heritage, considerable interest exists among academics and professionals, resulting in a growing body of guidelines from national museal associations that present a degree of conformity to each other, and to the international codes of ethics.
0	Abstract   This paper gives some information about the strategies for the functional rehabilitation of wood-made historical musical instruments, taking into due account the properties of this material. Actually, while for some types of wooden musical instruments it is possible to keep intact, or to recuperate, the (true or supposed) original voice and playability through quite straightforward steps during the restoration works, for other kinds of musical instruments made of wood, it is shown that a much more complex approach is required, and that a tool developed for monitoring the obtained results could be useful both for control and documentation purposes.
1	Abstract   Two new glycosides were isolated from the medicinal plant Polygala sibirica L. var. megalopha Fr. The compounds were identified as 2,6-dimethoxy-benzophenone-4-O-β- d -apiofuranosyl-(1 → 2)-β- d -glucopyranoside (1) and (6R, 7E, 9R)-9,13-dihydroxy-4,7-megastigmadien-3-one-9-O-[β-D-apiofurano-syl(1 → 6)-β- d -glucopyranoside (2) using 1D and 2D-NMR spectral data, as well as MALDI-TOF/TOF-MS data. Compounds 1 and 2 were evaluated for their inhibitory activities against xanthine oxidase (XO), and compound 2 showed similar activity to allopurinol, with an IC50 value of 6.48 μmol/L.
1	Abstract   Systemic amyloidoses are caused by misfolding-prone proteins that polymerize in tissues, causing organ dysfunction. Since proteins are etiological agents of these diseases, proteomics was soon recognized as a privileged instrument for their investigation. Mass spectrometry-based proteomics has acquired a fundamental role in management of systemic amyloidoses, being now considered a gold standard approach for amyloid typing. In parallel, approaches for analyzing circulating amyloid precursors have been developed. Moreover, differential and functional proteomics hold promise for identifying novel biomarkers and clarifying disease mechanisms. This review discusses recent proteomics achievements in systemic amyloidoses, providing a perspective on its present and future applications.
1	Two demonstration treatment wetland systems were studied for over four years. Both consisted of sedimentation basins, followed by wetland cells. The Imperial, CA system had four wetland cells totaling 4.7 ha, 25% vegetated with bulrushes (Schoenoplectus californicus), and the Brawley, CA system had two wetland cells totaling 1.8 ha, also 25% vegetated with bulrushes. Imperial received irrigation runoff water at 30 cm/day, and Brawley received New River water at 11 cm/day, both with moderately high levels of nutrients, sediments and pathogens. The systems seeped 40–60% of the incoming water. The hydraulic efficiencies of the systems were high because of compartmentalization and high aspect ratios. Concentration reductions of TN, TP and TSS were 50%, 39%, and 97% at Imperial, and 73%, 50% and 96% at Brawley. Imperial achieved about 1.5 log10 reductions in total coliforms, fecal coliforms and Escherichia coli, while Brawley achieved about 2.7 log10 reductions. The sedimentation basins settled most of the incoming TSS, as well as the algal solids that were generated in the basins. Algal uptake removed nutrients in the basins, which were supersaturated with oxygen. The wetlands were effective in denitrification, and trapped the remaining and generated TSS. Removal rate constants, corrected for infiltration, were at the high end of those reported for other wetlands.
1	Abstract   The aim of this work is to experimentally simulate two heat sources of fire, one placed at ground level, the other at a height above the ground, in order to determine the effect of source air entrainment on the resulting flow structure. The development of a free thermal plume was examined by generating a plume produced from an electrically heated disk at a constant temperature. We first studied the behavior of a thermal plume induced by a disk embedded in a horizontal plate placed at the level of the ground. This configuration ensured a regular lateral entrainment of air to the plume. The analysis of the average fields as well as the axial evolution of velocity and temperature showed an important widening of the profiles that encouraged a faster spread of the plume. We then determined the structure of the thermal plume generated by the same source placed at a height above the ground, ensuring simultaneous vertical and lateral entrainment of air into the resulting plume.  Results obtained reveal a vertical elongation of the average profiles that limits the lateral extension of the plume flow. Comparison of the plumes produced from the two configurations showed that the flow structure is strongly influenced by the nature of the source of air entrainment. An additional vertical contribution of air entrainment caused the location of the maximum axial velocity above the source to be raised, with the flow rate and the thermal flux absorbed by the air experiencing a relative increase of the order of 14% and 34%, respectively.
1	Based on the entrainment rate of isothermal jet, an application method of the isothermal model in tunnel fire was presented through the more reasonable estimation of total smoke flow rate and its density at jet exit. Acetone LIF measurement was performed to identify the entrainment of ambient air qualitatively, and the entrainment constants were provided with the results of a previous study of which jet velocity corresponded to that of this study. The entrainment effect was more remarkable for the smaller fire, because the normalized axial distance to ceiling was increased with decreasing the fire size. These results suggested that the present model considering the jet entrainment might enhance the previous isothermal model in tunnel fire.
0	Abstract   Gypsum plasterboard wall assemblies are extensively used as cladding material for walls, floors and ceilings, as well as a means for passive fire protection of timber structures. The good fire resistance characteristics of gypsum plasterboards are mainly owed to the gypsum “dehydration” process, occurring between 80 °C and 250 °C, where large quantities of energy are absorbed by evaporating water molecules, bound in the gypsum's crystal lattice. Aiming to enhance the prediction quality of numerical simulation tools, utilized to support the performance-based fire design of modern buildings, a gypsum dehydration numerical model is developed and validated. The model focuses on accurately describing the physical and chemical phenomena characterizing the gypsum dehydration process by employing a modelling approach based on solid reaction kinetics; temperature-dependent thermo-physical properties are also taken into account. The developed model is implemented in a Computational Fluid Dynamics code. Numerical results are validated by comparison to available temperature measurements obtained in a gypsum plasterboard wall assembly tested in a small-scale fire resistance furnace. Predictions of the developed model are found to agree reasonably well with the experimental data; a series of parametric studies is also performed aiming to investigate the effect of various modelling parameters.
0	An electrochemical study on the initial stages of copper electrodeposition onto nickel substrate from non-cyanide alkaline bath containing glycine as complexing agent is presented in this work. The studied parameters were copper concentration, glycine concentration, and deposition potential. Upon scanning in the negative direction, one cathodic peak was observed, which is associated to copper electrodeposition from CuL2 complex at pH 10.0 (where L− is the anion form of glycine). Analysis of the chronoamperograms indicates time-dependent nucleation mechanisms. A progressive nucleation mechanism without overlap of diffusion zones, which involved an electron transfer reaction (at short times) and a progressive nucleation mechanism with overlap of diffusion zones (at long times). Non-linear fitting methods were applied to obtain the growth and nucleation kinetic parameters from theoretical equations proposed to describe this system.
1	Abstract   Density functional theory (DFT) calculations of the relative stabilities and harmonic vibrational spectra of four different conformers of 4,7-bis(2,3-dihydrothieno[3,4-b][1,4]dioxin-5-yl)-2-phenyl-1H-benzo[d]imidazole (BImBEd) are presented and compared with experimental IR data. BImBEd, containing phenyl substituted benzimidazole as the acceptor and 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) as the donor unit, was electrochemically polymerized in different pH media earlier. Electronic states of nitrogen in benzimidazole unit of synthesized polymeric films were analyzed via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Both DFT and XPS results suggest the presence of an intramolecular H-bond between the amine of the imidazole and the oxygen of the EDOT molecules. Additionally, the quantity of the H-bond can be controlled via treatment of an acid (trifloroacetic acid) and a base (sodium hydroxide) as we stated in our previous study.
0	Abstract   In this work, a simple and accurate in vitro drug metabolism strategy was proposed by using macroporous ordered siliceous foam (MOSF) as a nanoreactor for confining the nanohybrid of CdTe quantum dots (QDs) and cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6). After CYP2D6 was coupled to QDs through the carbodiimide coupling chemistry, the resulting nanohybrid of CYP2D6/QDs exhibited fluorescence emission at 645 nm, which could be used as a photocatalyst for drug metabolism. The energy level of CYP2D6 was located between the conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB) of QDs, which provided the possibility of the electron transferring from the CB of QDs to CYP2D6. Tramadol was chosen as the model substrate. Under the irradiation of a white-light, the photocurrent increased with the addition of tramadol in a wide linear range from 4.0 μM to 100 μM. The apparent Michaelis–Menten constant was measured to be 3.6 μM. The high performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (HPLC–MS) confirmed the production of metabolite of o-desmethyltramadol. Such nanoreactor provided a suitable environment to confine a mass of enzyme, as well as to maintain their catalytic activities for highly effective drug metabolic reactions. This showed promising potential for immobilizing various enzymes and other biomolecules in biomimetic metabolism study.
0	Abstract   The main objective of this work was to investigate the effect of two transition metals (0–9 mol% ZrCl 4  and HfCl 4 ) on hydrogen desorption/absorption of NaAlH 4  and LiAlH 4 . The hydrogen desorption was carried out over a wide temperature range of 25–   280        ∘    C    while the hydrogen absorption took place at    125        ∘    C    and between 50–   125        ∘    C    for NaAlH 4  and LiAlH 4 , respectively, with the same pressure of 11 MPa. The result revealed that the transition metals (Zr and Hf) could improve the kinetics of the hydrogen desorption on NaAlH 4 . NaAlH 4  doped with HfCl 4  released hydrogen at the lower temperature than that of ZrCl 4 -doped NaAlH 4 . In addition, the rate of hydrogen desorption increased with increasing the amount of HfCl 4  doping. However, the maximum hydrogen capacity of    ∼  5.5    wt  %    was obtained from the first desorption, and dropped to 2.2–2.6 wt% in the subsequent cycles. This may be because of, after the hydrogen desorption, the hydrides melt due to the high temperature resulted in agglomeration of the hydrides and segregation of Al. XRD results showed the formation of NaCl after milling of NaAlH 4  with 4 mol% HfCl 4  and no evidence of any Hf-containing phase. However, with 10 mol% HfCl 4 , the formation between Al and Hf in the form of Al 3 Hf was observed. This compound may act as catalyst in the reversible hydrogen desorption/absorption. For LiAlH 4 , ZrCl 4  or HfCl 4  also enhanced the kinetics of desorption of LiAlH 4 . Moreover, it was observed that LiAlH 4  released hydrogen during the milling. After the hydrogen desorption from LiAlH 4 , no hydrogen absorption was observed for the undoped hydride or that doped with HfCl 4  or ZrCl 4 . This may be because of the instability of LiAlH 4 . Moreover, milling and dopant may also destabilize the structure of LiAlH 4  causing the irreversibility of hydrogen desorption/absorption on LiAlH 4 .
0	Abstract   Hydrogen sulphide, an acid gas, is generally considered an environmental pollutant. As an industrial byproduct, it is produced mostly during fuel processing. Hydrogen sulphide occurs naturally in many gas wells and also in gas hydrates and gas-saturated sediments especially at the bottom of the Black Sea where 90% of the sea water is anaerobic.  The anoxic conditions exist in the deepest parts of the basin since nearly 7300 years, caused by the density stratification following the significant influx of the Mediterranean water through the Bosphorous nearly 9000 years ago. Here,      H    2    S    is believed to be produced by sulphur reducing bacteria at an approximate rate of 10 000 tons per day, and it poses a serious threat since it keeps reducing the life in the Black Sea. An oxygen–hydrogen sulphide interface is established at 150–200 m below the surface after which      H    2    S    concentration starts increasing regularly until 1000 m, and finally reaches a nearly constant value of 9.5 mg/l around 1500 m depth.  Hydrogen sulphide potentially has economic value if both sulphur and hydrogen can be recovered. Several methods are studied for      H    2    S    decomposition, including thermal, thermochemical, electrochemical, photochemical and plasmochemical methods.  In the present work,      H    2    S    potential in the Black Sea is investigated as a source of hydrogen, an evaluation of the developing prominent techniques for hydrogen production from      H    2    S    is made, and an engineering assessment is carried out regarding hydrogen production from      H    2    S    in the Black Sea using a process design based on the catalytic solar thermolysis approach. Possibility of a modular plant is considered for production at larger scale.
0	Abstract   Activated charcoal supported nickel-based catalysts such as Ni/AC, Ni–Y/AC, Ni–Fe/AC, and Ni–Co/AC were formulated and their catalytic activity for the gasification of glucose in supercritical water were investigated using a packed-bed reactor at 650 °C, 28 MPa. A set of glucose gasification experiments was also carried out without catalyst and with AC to provide baseline data. Loading of small amounts of Y to the Ni/AC catalyst appeared to increase both the extent of gasification and hydrogen yield while loading of Fe or Co metal to the Ni/AC catalyst did not give any positive effect on the gasification results. Effect of catalyst composition, temperature, reactant concentration, and reactor residence time on the glucose gasification with the Ni–Y/AC catalyst was examined. Catalyst analysis indicates that adding of Y into the Ni/AC catalyst inhibited carbon formation to a great extent, thereby maintaining catalytic activity of the Ni metal for H2 formation reactions.
1	Abstract   In this study, the biohydrogen production from POME was performed under mesophillic conditions by mixed culture in a 2 L bioreactor using the optimized conditions obtained previously. The effect of controlling pH initially or throughout the fermentation was also examined. The fermentation performance was monitored by comparing P, Rm, λ, and Ps in both systems. In this present study, the reactor system showed higher hydrogen production potential values with the utilization of pH control. Hydrogen production potential was increased two folds when the reactor system was equipped with pH control rather than just fixed the initial pH at 5.8. The biohydrogen production under controlled pH occurred after 7 h fermentation resulting in maximum Ps and Rm of 1.32 L/L POME and 0.144 L/L.h, respectively.
1	Abstract   Glycerol is an inevitable by-product from biodiesel synthesis process and could be a promising feedstock for fermentative hydrogen production. In this study, the feasibility of using crude glycerol from biodiesel industry for biohydrogen production was evaluated using seven isolated hydrogen-producing bacterial strains (Clostridium butyricum, Clostridium pasteurianum, and Klebsiella sp.). Among the strains examined, C. pasteurianum CH4 exhibited the best biohydrogen-producing performance under the optimal conditions of: temperature, 35 °C; initial pH, 7.0; agitation rate, 200 rpm; glycerol concentration, 10 g/l. When using pure glycerol as carbon source for continuous hydrogen fermentation, the average H2 production rate and H2 yield were 103.1 ± 8.1 ml/h/l and 0.50 ± 0.02 mol H2/mol glycerol, respectively. In contrast, when using crude glycerol as the carbon source, the H2 production rate and H2 yield was improved to 166.0 ± 8.7 ml/h/l and 0.77 ± 0.05 mol H2/mol glycerol, respectively. This work demonstrated the high potential of using biodiesel by-product, glycerol, for cost-effective biohydrogen production.
0	Abstract   The objective of this work was to rationalize effects on electrocatalytic reactivity of the coarse grained polycrystalline Ni-cathodes: bulk (Ni), foam (3D-Ni), and electrodeposited (ed-Ni) in comparison with effects on reactivity of nanocrystalline nickel catalyst (nc-Ni) for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in 1.0 M NaOH solution.  Nickel crystal nanoparticles of the average grain size d = 17 nm in the nc-Ni catalyst initiate spillover of adsorbed hydrogen species while the intercrystalline volume fraction (equal to 39%) acts as the acceptor of these species. The influence of the spillover effect of adsorbed hydrogen to overall rate of HER was investigated in situ using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). According to both voltammetry and EIS results the intrinsic reactivity of the polycrystalline Ni-cathodes investigated for the hydrogen evolution reaction increases as follows: ed-Ni
0	Abstract   (Quasi-)Amorphous molybdenum sulfide (MoSx) materials with disulfide (S22−) units have superior catalytic activities for hydrogen evolution reaction. However, the structures of the materials are less investigated and diversified. Herein, we first develop a new ethanol-thermal method to prepare MoSx and further apply versatile confined growth treatment with low-cost filler crystallites to efficiently modify its structure and consequent performance. Expectedly, because the material is quasi-amorphous and very deformable, its morphology varies dramatically from granules to foam-like material with specific surface area increases from 22.53 m2/g to 76.24 m2/g under the restriction of confined spaces. Importantly, the amount of S22− units which are responsible for the distinction of MoSx increases as well. By virtue of the confined growth, the catalytic performance of the original material on hydrogen evolution is improved significantly. The over-potential required to obtain 10 mA cm−2 current decreases remarkably from 278 mV to 209 mV and the Tafel slope decreases from 160 mV/decade to 72 mV/decade after confined growth. Therefore, we have proposed an effective method to synthesize and promote the catalytic performance of MoSx.
1	The feasibility of using complexes with cyclodextrins (CDs) in nicardipine (NC) controlled delivery has been examined, with a view to extending the pharmaceutical applications spectrum of these carriers. For a fast release fraction, a hydrophilic β-cyclodextrin derivative (hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin) was employed to form a water-soluble complex. For the sustained-releasing portion, triacetyl-β-cyclodextrin (TAβCD) was used to provide complexes with appropriate hydrophobicity. An optimal formulation was designed by the combination of each fraction in different mixing ratios. The release behaviour of the complexes, as well as of their mixtures, was examined in simulated gastric (pH 1.2) and intestinal (pH 6.8) fluids. The formulations released the drug rapidly at the initial stage, followed by a slow release. The drug release rate was markedly retarded in the increasing order of the amount of NC/TAβCD complex. When NC was administered to rabbits, its absorption was very rapid with a short elimination half-life, while a prolonged maintenance of the plasma levels was obtained for the two selected formulations. The drug bioavailability was considerably improved especially after the administration of the mixture of hydrophilic and hydrophobic complexes, when compared with the NC/TAβCD complex. The results suggested that the critical combination of hydrophilic and hydrophobic CDs complexes, in appropriate ratios, could be a promising drug delivery system with a prolonged therapeutic effect coupled with a more balanced bioavailability.
0	Bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) releasing scaffolds are routinely used in bone tissue engineering to accelerate regeneration. Thus, assessing growth factor activity, and tissue regeneration around a biomaterial delivery system is extremely important to optimize the stages of bone healing. Such assessment commonly relies on histology. A non-invasive method would allow longitudinal monitoring of the regeneration process. The present study sought to explore the feasibility of Positron Emission Tomography (PET) as a non-invasive method to monitor the osteogenic potential of a BMP-2 releasing calcium phosphate cement (CPC) bone substitute. In a calvarial defect model in rats, (18)F-Fluoride PET was used to quantify (18)F-Fluoride uptake around the BMP-2/CPC material. As controls, non-loaded porous CPC, dense CPC and autograft samples were used. PET was performed every two weeks, during a period of 8weeks post-implantation. In parallel, computed tomography (CT) imaging was performed for anatomical reference. Four specimens were evaluated per group per time point. The highest (18)F-Fluoride signal intensity was measured in the BMP-2 group (approximately 5 times higher than the baseline value), followed by the controls in the order, from high to low, porous, dense and autograft. The same trend was maintained during the entire experimental period. Histology and measurements of the bone volume percentage confirmed the significantly higher new bone formation in the BMP-2 releasing group (about 25%), compared to the controls. Moreover, (18)F-Fluoride PET uptake showed a statistically significant positive correlation (r=0.6038, P=0.0171) with the newly formed bone volume. In conclusion, our results support the use of a PET/CT method for the longitudinal monitoring of BMP-2 releasing scaffolds, in vivo.
0	Abstract   Through combining a eutectic mixture of capric–lauric–palmitic acid (CA–LA–PA) as phase change material (PCM) and SiO2 nanofibers as supporting material, a novel form-stable PCM based composite was fabricated and studied for thermal energy storage and retrieval. Specifically, the SiO2 nanofibers, prepared via electrospinning followed by a high temperature annealing process, were used to absorb and/or support the PCM consisted of CA–LA–PA eutectic mixture. The structure, morphology and thermal property of prepared CA–LA–PA eutectic mixture, electrospun SiO2 nanofibers and composite PCM were characterized by Fourier transfer infrared (FT-IR) spectra, Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Differential scanning calorimeter (DSC), respectively. The results showed the electrospun SiO2 nanofibers were successfully fabricated with high porosity which is capable of absorbing a large amount of PCM; and the CA–LA–PA was uniformly absorbed into porous framework of SiO2 nanofibers. In addition, the phase transition temperatures of CA–LA–PA eutectic mixture were lower than those of individual fatty acids. The melting and crystallization temperatures and heat enthalpies of composite PCM were 21.7 and 6.4 °C, and 100.9 and 96.5 kJ/kg, respectively; indicating that the composite PCM possessed appropriate phase transition temperatures and high latent heat. Thermal cycling test results showed that there were no noticeable variations on the phase transition temperatures and heat enthalpies after 50 thermal cycles; revealing that the prepared form-stable composite PCM is promising for thermal energy storage/retrieval due to the good thermal reliability and stability.
1	Abstract   This paper presents the development and implementation of an enhanced forced switching sliding mode control (FSSMC), for dual inverter-based single stage solar photovoltaic (PV) system a stand-alone. A dual inverter fed open winding three-phase transformer is used to supply a stand-alone load in the considered topology. The FSSMC is developed for the current control of the dual inverter, while the dc-link voltage control loop is developed through indirect vector control. The solar irradiance and load impedance variations are successfully handled by the developed control scheme. The stability and disturbance rejection analyses are conducted on a linear model of the system to characterize the dynamic properties of the system and to evaluate the robustness of the controllers. The controller is implemented in simulation and experimental environments at different operating conditions. Experimental tests have been conducted on a laboratory scaled prototype using the digital controller. The performance is found to be satisfactory and have been successfully verified with the real time results.
0	Aromatics growth beyond 2-, 3-ring PAH is analyzed through a radical-molecule reaction mechanism which, in combination with a previously developed PAH model, is able to predict the size distribution of aromatic structures formed in rich premixed flames of ethylene at atmospheric pressure with C/O ratios across the soot threshold limit. Modeling results are in good agreement with experimental data and are used to interpret the ultraviolet absorption and the light scattering measured in flames before soot inception. The model shows that the total number concentration of high molecular mass aromatics and the different moments of the size distribution are functions of both the PAH and H-atom concentrations, two quantities which have different trends as functions of the residence time and the C/O ratio. Regimes of nearly stoichiometric or slightly rich premixed combustion are dominated by reactions between aromatics which lead to the formation of particles with sizes of the order of 3 to 4 nm. At higher C/O ratios the formation of nanoparticles is less efficient. Particles with sizes of the order of 2 nm are predicted in flames at the threshold of soot formation, whereas particles with sizes around 1 to 1.5 nm are predicted in fully sooting conditions.
1	Microfabrication techniques are increasingly used in different fields of chemistry to realize structures with capabilities exceeding those of conventional macroscopic systems. In addition to already demonstrated chemical and biological analysis applications, microfabricated chemical systems are expected to have a number of advantages for chemical synthesis, chemical kinetics studies, and process development. Chemical processing advantages from increased heat and mass transfer in small dimensions are demonstrated with model gas, liquid, and multiphase reaction systems. These case studies also serve to illustrate benefits of integrating sensors for flow, temperature, and chemical composition with microfluidic reaction and control components. The role of reaction engineering in the development of microreaction technology is described along with new approaches to scale up based upon replication of microchemical devices.
0	Abstract   Randomly packed fixed-bed reactors are widely used in the chemical process industries. Their design is usually based on pseudo-homogeneous model equations with averaged semi-empirical parameters. However, this design concept fails for low tube-to-particle diameter ratios (=aspect ratios) where local phenomena dominate. The complete three-dimensional (3D) structure of the packing has therefore to be considered in order to resolve the local inhomogeneities.  New numerical methods and the increase of computational power allow us to simulate in detail single phase reacting flows in such reactors, exclusively based on material properties and the 3D description of the geometry, thus without the use of semi-empirical data. The successive simulation steps (packing generation, fluid flow and species calculation) and their validation with experimental data are described in this paper. In order to synthetically generate realistic random packings of spherical particles, we apply a Monte-Carlo method. The subsequent numerical simulation of the 3D flow field and coupled mass transport of reacting species is done by means of lattice Boltzmann methods. The simulation results reveal that not only the local behaviour but also integral quantities like the pressure drop depend remarkably on the local structural properties of the packings, a feature which is neglected when using correlations with averaged values.
0	Abstract   The effects of temperature on the kinetics of anaerobic sulphate reduction were studied in continuous bioreactors using acetate as an electron donor. Across the range of temperatures applied from 20 to    35        ∘    C   , the increasing of volumetric loading rate up to 0.08 to    0.1    kg      m    -  3        h    -  1      resulted in a linear increase in reduction rate of sulphate. The increasing reaction rate showed a lower dependence on volumetric loading rate in the range 0.1–   0.15    kg      m    -  3        h    -  1     . Further increase in volumetric loading rate above    0.15    kg      m    -  3        h    -  1      was accompanied by wash out of bacterial cells and a sharp decrease in reaction rate. Despite a similar pattern for dependency of reaction rate on volumetric loading at all temperatures tested, the magnitude of reaction rate was influenced by temperature, with a maximum rate of    0.075    kg      m    -  3        h    -  1      observed at    35        ∘    C   . The effect of temperature on maximum specific growth rate (     μ    max     ) and bacterial yield was insignificant. The values of maximum specific growth rate and yield were    0.06      h    -  1      and 0.56–0.60 kg bacteria (   kg      sulphate    -  1     ), respectively. The decay coefficient (     k    d     ) and apparent saturation constant (     K    s    ′     ) were both temperature dependent. The increase of temperature resulted in decreased values of      K    s    ′     , and higher values for      k    d     . Using the experimental data effect of temperature was incorporated in a kinetic model previously developed for anaerobic reduction of sulphate.
0	Abstract   Thermochemical energy storage can accomplish the need of long-term and long-distance storage and thus it is very important in many industrial applications, such as waste heat recovery, solar energy utilization, etc. In this study, we have investigated the micro-mechanism of chemical heat storage, as well as the micro-mechanism of Li or Mg catalysis in the heat storage, by using the first principle method and transition state theory. Thermodynamic analysis shows that the doped materials are relatively stable. Furthermore, through the micro scale comparison between the undoped and doped systems in terms of the transition state, energy barrier and electronic density of states (DOS), the effects of doping on macroscopic heat storage process are inferred. The changes of molecular structures of transition state imply that the chemical reaction kinetic is modified. The reduction of the energy barrier from 0.40 eV to 0.11 eV further indicates the dehydration reaction (i.e., heat storage process) can be accomplished at a lower temperature with Li doping. The narrowed pseudogap width in the DOS means that with Li doping the OH bonds of Ca(OH)2 can be more easily broken and the dehydration speed is higher at the same temperature. In contrast, we conclude that the Mg cation doping has little impact on the heat storage process, since the results of the micro-mechanism analysis with Mg doping remain almost unchanged. The experimental results show that the time needed for dehydration process is reduced after Li doping, which agree well with our analysis of the energy barrier and electronic density of states.
1	Abstract   Continuous high speed pin mixers have been successfully implemented industrially to mix high fractions of powders into highly viscous non-Newtonian liquids. However, they have not been described in the literature yet. This work presents a multi-method approach, consisting of conventional torque and throughput measurements to calculate average residence times and dimensionless Reynolds/power numbers for suspension mixing, Positron Emission Particle Tracking (PEPT) to gain information on particle trajectories and velocities in the investigated opaque model system, high speed film visualization and CFD simulations. By the combination of these methods, valuable information on the influence of variable process parameters, particularly on the influence of pin configuration, pin shape and inclination of semi-cylindrical pins on mixing mechanisms and efficiency, could be gathered for a broad range of viscosities and powder fractions in Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids. Flow patterns such as a “Split-and-Recombine” convection pattern at the pins, axial mixing mechanisms and beneficial process conditions to reduce particle sedimentation caused by centrifugal forces in the mixer were retrieved from the results. The PEPT methodology was successfully implemented for a high-shear continuous mixing process of suspensions for the first time. As the combined methodology shows reasonable and reliable results that were also applicable at industrial scale, the work provides sound basis for further research development of measurement techniques for other mixing processes, especially in opaque systems.
1	The detailed impinging annular jet characteristics with/without induced swirling motion are experimentally studied. Obtained flow and wall pressure data confirm the classical observation for conventional annular impinging jet, with the flow exhibiting simple round impinging jet-like features at sufficiently large separation distances. In contrast, no such transition occurs in the presence of swirling. At short and intermediate separation distances, the swirling annular jet causes more non-uniform distributions of wall pressure and heat transfer on the impingement plate compared to the conventional annular jet. However, the reverse holds at large separation distances.
1	Abstract   The paper gives the basic results of experimental investigation of boiling heat transfer in heat-absorbing devices of the ITER thermonuclear reactor, which are subjected to one-side heating. The experimental data on heat transfer at nucleate and film boiling and on critical heat fluxes are obtained in the following range of parameters of water flow: pressure p = 0.7–2.0 MPa, mass flux G = 340–25 000 kg/(m2 s), and water temperature at the inlet Tin = 20–60 °C. A twisted tape is inserted in the circular channel in order to form swirling flow of water. The investigations are performed for tapes with different values of flow swirl coefficient, as well for test sections without a tape. Appropriate calculation formulas are derived, which reliably generalize the experimental data.
0	While particle aggregates play a central role in recent models for nanofluid thermal conductivity, the effect of particle diffusion in a temperature field on the aggregation and transport has yet to be studied in depth. The present work separates the effects of particle aggregation and diffusion using parallel plate experiments, infrared microscopy, Monte Carlo simulations, and rate equations for particle and heat transport. The predicted thermal conductivity and viscosity enhancements are compared to determine the favorability of aggregating nanofluids. Experimental data show non-uniform temporal increases in thermal conductivity and are well described through simulation of the combination of particle aggregation and diffusion. The simulation shows concentration distributions due to thermal diffusion causing variations in aggregation, thermal conductivity and viscosity. The aggregation produces an unfavorable nanofluid. An optimum nanoparticle diameter is calculated to minimize settling, thermal diffusion and aggregation.
1	Abstract   Vapor-phase hydrogenation of toluene and selective hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde (2-butenal) have been performed at 333 K over Cl-free Pt/ZrO 2  and Pt/Ce  x  Zr 1− x  O 2  catalysts (   0.2  ⩽  x  ⩽  0.8   ) after reduction under H 2  at low (473 K) and high (773 K) temperatures. The catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, temperature-programmed reduction, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy after each reduction treatment. An important effect of the support composition on the catalytic activity was observed for both reactions. The catalytic behavior of Pt in the two test reactions studied was strongly dependent on the support composition and on the reduction temperature. For toluene hydrogenation, after reduction at 473 K, catalytic activity was higher for catalysts with no or low ceria content. Furthermore, whereas the increase in the reduction temperature hardly modified the activity of Pt/ZrO 2 , it strongly deactivated the catalysts with high cerium content in the support. For crotonaldehyde hydrogenation, on the other hand, increased reduction temperature produced a general increase in activity (except for the catalyst with the highest cerium content), along with an increase in selectivity toward the hydrogenation of the carbonyl bond to yield crotyl alcohol. The results are explained on the basis of the effect of partial reduction of Ce(IV) in the support.
0	Abstract   A novel heterogenized FeR 4 P–SiO 2  shows enhanced catalytic efficiency for PCP conversion  vs.  the homogeneous FeR 4 P catalyst. The heterogenized FeR 4 P–SiO 2  catalyst is highly recyclable in the presence of imidazole in solution. EPR and DR-UV–Vis data provide direct evidence that high-valent iron species [R 4 P +    Fe IV  O] are formed in the heterogenized FeR 4 P–SiO 2  system. The electron spin density of the a 1u  cation radical (Por +    ) is mainly localised on the tetrapyrole frame, and this results in the observed weak magnetic coupling between the  S  = 1 oxo-ferryl moiety (Fe IV  O) and the  S  ′  = 1/2 porphyrin cation radical (Por +    ). A catalytic cycle mechanism is suggested. Accordingly, the reduction in [R 4 P +    Fe IV  O] can proceed  via  a substrate molecule, in a one electron-transfer, thus producing [R 4 PFe IV ] plus a radical entity derived from the substrate. Then, a second electron-transfer to [R 4 PFe IV ] leads to the regeneration of the initial R 4 PFe III  state. This second electron can originate from either a substrate molecule or a radical substrate species.
0	Abstract   A Density Functional Theory based first-principles kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) study of the water gas shift reaction on the stepped Cu(3 2 1) surface is presented. We use the recently developed graph-theoretical kMC approach coupled with cluster expansion Hamiltonians to model the coverage-dependent energy barriers for the different surface processes, including adsorption/desorption, diffusion and other elementary chemical reactions, totalling 36 elementary steps, which allow two possible competitive mechanisms: surface redox and associative COOH. All results are compared to a previous kMC study on Cu(1 1 1). Both mechanisms are observed for Cu(3 2 1) surface with different extensions, whereas the associative COOH one was the dominant for Cu(1 1 1). The present study shows that, in spite of encompassing lower activation energy barriers, stepped surfaces do not necessarily have an overall larger catalytic activity. Coverage effects and the significant contribution of some of the reverse processes are behind this behaviour.
1	In the Arctic tundra, subsurface drainage occurs predominantly through the saturated zone within the layer of peat that mantles the hillslopes. In plan view, the peat cover is fragmented into a network of channels due to the presence of mineral earth hummocks. In cross section, the physical and hydraulic properties of the peat vary with depth and the water transmission characteristics (e.g. hydraulic conductivity) of the upper profile differ distinctly from those of the lower. Water flow through the peat is laminar, therefore the friction factor ( f ) and the Reynolds number (NR) are inversely related. Average values for the coefficientC of the relation f a C=NR; vary from ,300 near the surface to ,14,500 at depth. This large difference in C confirms that the larger-diameter soil pores of the living vegetation and lightly decomposed peat near the surface offer much less resistance to water motion than the finer-grained peat deeper in the profile. Also, the variability suggests that subsurface drainage is strongly affected by the position and thickness of the saturated zone within the peat matrix. A first approximation for a model or simulation of the flow regime may consider a peat profile with depth-varying, resistance properties in respect to subsurface flow. q 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

1	Summary   In this study we analyse space–time variability of soil moisture data collected at 0–6, 0–12 and 0–20 cm depth over three hillslopes with contrasting steep relief and shallow soil depth in the Dolomites (central-eastern Italian Alps). The data have been collected during two summer seasons (2005 and 2006) with different precipitation distribution. Analysis of soil moisture data shows that different physical processes control the space–time distribution of soil moisture at the three soil depths, with a marked effect of dew on the 0–6 cm soil depth layer. The range of skewness values decreases markedly from the surface to deeper layers. More symmetric distributions, characterised by relatively low skewness, are found for mid-range soil moisture contents, while highly skewed distributions (generally with more log–normal shape) are found at dry and wet conditions. Scatter plots drawn for the whole data set and the analysis of the correlation coefficients suggest a good persistence of soil moisture with depth: the highest degree of correlation was observed between data collected at 0–12 and 0–20 cm.  Examination of correlation between soil moisture fields and topographical attributes shows that, notwithstanding the steep relief and the humid conditions, terrain indices are relatively poor predictors of soil moisture spatial variability. The slope and the topographic wetness index, which are found here the best univariate spatial predictors of soil moisture, explains up to 42% of the time-averaged moisture spatial variation.  A negative relationship between the soil moisture spatial mean and the corresponding spatial standard deviation is found for mean water contents exceeding 25–30%, while a transition to a positive relationship is observed with drier conditions. Overall, soil moisture variability shows the highest values at moderate moisture conditions (23–29%) and reduced values for wetter and drier conditions for all depths. A negative linear relationship between mean soil moisture content and the coefficient of variation was observed.  A soil moisture dynamics model proved to successfully capture the soil moisture variability at the hillslope scale. The simulated time series of hillslope-averaged soil moisture are in good agreement with the observed ones. Moreover, the model reproduces consistently the observed relationships between soil moisture spatial mean and corresponding variability.
1	Summary   To evaluate potential hydrological impacts of changes in vegetation over a shallow sandy aquifer in subtropical Australia, we estimated groundwater recharge and discharge by evapotranspiration ( ET g  ) under three vegetation covers. Estimates were obtained over two years (November 2011–October 2013) using the water table fluctuation method and the White method, respectively. Depth-dependent specific yields were determined for estimation of recharge and  ET g  . Our results show that the average annual gross recharge was largest at the sparse grassland (∼52% of net rainfall), followed by the exotic pine plantation (∼39% of net rainfall) and then the native banksia woodland (∼27% of net rainfall). Lower recharge values at forested sites resulted from higher rainfall interception and reduced storage capacity of the vadose zone due to lower elevations when the water table approaches the soil surface. During 169 rain-free days when the White method was applied, pine trees extracted nearly twice as much groundwater through  ET g   as the banksia, whereas no groundwater use by grasses was detected. Groundwater use is largely controlled by meteorological drivers but further mediated by depth to water table. The resulting annual net recharge (gross recharge minus  ET g  ) at the pine plantation was comparable to that of the banksia woodland but only half of the corresponding value at the grassland. Vegetation cover impacts potential groundwater recharge and discharge, but in these subtropical shallow water table environments estimates of potential recharge based on rainfall data need to take into account the often limited recharge capacity in the wet season.
1	Summary   A semi-analytical solution considering the vertical unsaturated flow is developed for groundwater flow in response to a slug test in an unconfined aquifer in Laplace space. The new solution incorporates the effects of partial penetrating, anisotropy, vertical unsaturated flow, and a moving water table boundary. Compared to the Kansas Geological Survey (KGS) model, the new solution can significantly improve the fittings of the modeled to the measured hydraulic heads at the late stage of slug tests in an unconfined aquifer, particularly when the slug well has a partially submerged screen and moisture drainage above the water table is significant. The radial hydraulic conductivities estimated with the new solution are comparable to those from the KGS, Bouwer and Rice, and Hvorslev methods. In addition, the new solution also can be used to examine the vertical conductivity, specific storage, specific yield, and the moisture retention parameters in an unconfined aquifer based on slug test data.
1	In a nuclear power plant the steam generator tubes cover a major portion of the primary pressure-retaining boundary. Thus, very conservative approaches have been taken in the light of steam generator tube integrity. According to the present criteria, tubes wall-thinned in excess of 40% should be plugged whatever the cause. However, many analytical and experimental results have shown that no safety problems exist even with thickness reductions greater than 40%. The present criterion was developed about 20 years ago when wear and pitting were dominant causes for steam generator tube degradation, and it is based on tubes with single cracks regardless of the fact that the appearance of multiple cracks is more common in general. The objective of this study is to review the conservatism of the present plugging criteria of steam generator tubes and to propose a new coalescence model for two adjacent through-wall cracks existing in steam generator tubes. Using the existing failure models and experimental results, we reviewed the conservatism of the present plugging criteria. In order to verify the usefulness of the proposed new coalescence model, we performed finite element analysis and some parametric studies. Then, we developed a coalescence evaluation diagram.
1	Abstract   Thousands of quasi laminar defects, which are parallel to the surface, were recently observed in the Belgian reactors pressure vessels of Doel 3 and Tihange 2 nuclear power plants. This is the first time that such kind of cracks has been detected in a reactor pressure vessel (RPV) by using new non-destructive testing (NDT) equipment (in service inspection). These flaws are likely to be originated during the vessels production and it seems improbable that the flaws further evolved since their formation. However, a structural integrity analysis for the case of pressurized thermal shock loads is necessary to assess the safe operation. The existence of such cracks was never before assumed in pressurized thermal shocks (PTSs) analyses as these defects are supposed as nonexistent in the RPV or their effect regarded as non-dangerous. However, up to the author's knowledge, there are no evidences or studies that support these assumptions as no former comparison has been found. Hence, we present a PTS analysis for such type of crack where the eXtended Finite Element Method (XFEM) is employed to simplify the finite element meshing. The analysis includes the comparison of different crack locations, size and configurations and allows concluding that such kind of defects are not dangerous from a structural mechanics point of view, as long as they remain parallel to the surface.
1	Abstract   ERCOSAM and SAMARA are the acronyms for two parallel projects co-financed respectively by EURATOM and ROSATOM during the period 2010–2014 with the general aim to advance the knowledge on the phenomenology associated with the hydrogen and steam spreading and stratification in the LWR containment during a postulated severe accident. The important peculiarity of the projects was in experimental and analytical investigating the impact of systems such as spray, cooler and heat sources (simulating thermal effect of PARs) on the distribution of gas mixture (e.g. hydrogen, steam, air). This paper presents the main outcomes of the ERCOSAM–SAMARA projects.
0	Abstract   The detachment of liquid droplets from porous material surfaces used with proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells under the influence of a cross-flowing air is investigated computationally and experimentally. CCD images taken on a purpose-built transparent fuel cell have revealed that the water produced within the PEM is forming droplets on the surface of the gas-diffusion layer. These droplets are swept away if the velocity of the flowing air is above a critical value for a given droplet size. Static and dynamic contact angle measurements for three different carbon gas-diffusion layer materials obtained inside a transparent air-channel test model have been used as input to the numerical model; the latter is based on a Navier–Stokes equations flow solver incorporating the volume of fluid (VOF) two-phase flow methodology. Variable contact angle values around the gas–liquid–solid contact-line as well as their dynamic change during the droplet shape deformation process, have allowed estimation of the adhesion force between the liquid droplet and the solid surface and successful prediction of the separation line at which droplets loose their contact from the solid surface under the influence of the air stream flowing around them. Parametric studies highlight the relevant importance of various factors affecting the detachment of the liquid droplets from the solid surface.
0	Nonionic alkyl poly(oxyethylene) surfactants (Brij 56) films on a silicon substrate were treated with a tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) vapor. Mesostructured silica films were formed through a nano-phase transition under the infiltration of TEOS into the surfactant films. It was found that the calcined film had a 3D pore structure from the field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) observations in a different orientation. Grazing angle of incidence small angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS) measurement results showed that the symmetry of the film was an Fmmm space group oriented with the (010) plane parallel to the surface. The ordered structure of the films showed higher thermal stability than the films prepared by a conventional solvent-evaporation method.
0	Abstract   A homologous series of novel heterogemini surfactants, (   N  ,  N   -dimethyl-N-[3-(alkyloxy)-2-hydroxypropyl]-alkylammonium bromide (referred to as CmOhpNCn; m,    n  =  10   , 8; 12, 8; 14, 8; 16, 8; 14, 10; 12, 12 and 10, 14) were synthesized. Their thermotropic phase behavior was investigated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), polarizing optical microscopy (POM), infrared spectroscopy (IR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). All the compounds showed high thermal stability and formed enantiotropic thermotropic smectic A liquid crystals. The mesophase region was sensitive to the overall length (   m  +  n   ) of the two hydrophobic tails and was widened with increasing (   m  +  n   ). When fixing the overall length of the two hydrophobic tails (   m  +  n  =  24   ), the liquid crystal region was affected little by the dissymmetry of the two hydrophobic chains. The combination of IR and XRD results suggested the cis-configuration of the alkyl chain and the alkoxy chain with respect to the extended N–CH2–CH(OH) skeleton in both crystal lattice and liquid crystal mesophase. The folding of the alkoxy chain at the carbon atom connecting the hydroxyl group led to the hydrogen bonding between the hydroxyl and the Br− counterion, which is beneficial to stabilizing the liquid crystal phase.
0	In this study two routes for the gelation of water glass have been investigated; the destabilization by a change in pH and by an increase in concentration through evaporation. Both methods produce optically transparent, highly viscous, homogeneous solutions. The structure and dynamics of the solutions along the two routes have been investigated with Dynamic Light Scattering, 29Si-Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy, viscosity measurements and infrared spectroscopy. We find that the two routes are fundamentally different. Increasing the concentration of the sodium silicate system leaves the silica speciation apparently unchanged. Lowering the pH leads to condensation reactions, thus a change in the silica speciation.
1	Seawater desalination has become an important way to solve the crisis of fresh water resource. Due to the new developments in membrane technology, reverse osmosis (RO) has gained momentum over the last decade for the desalination of seawater. Proper pretreatment is the most critical factor for successful long-term performance of seawater reverse osmosis plants. The purpose of this pilot testing was to assess the potential of ultrafiltration (UF) prior to RO for high turbidity seawater desalination. The UF systems were set up at the seaside in Yuhuan, Zhejiang province, in China. The Omexell™-SFP was the one of the membranes used. Pilot testing results were obtained on Yuhuan seawater using the outside-in hollow-fiber Omexell™-SFP UF module in dead-end mode. The testing was fed directly by high turbidity seawater for about 50 days, and then turned to use coagulation seawater. The study showed that the UF system provided the permeate water with high and constant quality no matter regardless of feed water; the SDI15 was maintained below 3, meeting the demand for intake water quality of RO. The suitable NaClO concentration dose was beneficial to a filtrate SDI decrease. Other parameters such as total Fe, COD, colloidal Si and total bacterial count were also measured. The pilot rig was operated at different fluxes ranging from 50–100 L/m2.h with and without coagulant addition. Coagulation of raw seawater could help to increase the flux of the UF membrane and provide filtered seawater in a steady-state condition.
0	Abstract   An anaerobic cross-flow ultrafiltration membrane bioreactor was investigated for municipal wastewater treatment at 37°C. The removal of the total suspended solid, the soluble chemical oxygen demand and the biochemical oxygen demand were respectively 100%, 90% and 88%. Less than 85 mg l−1 of soluble chemical oxygen demand in the effluent was obtained by ranging the organic loading rate from 0.23 to 2 g COD l−1 d−1. The biomass accumulated in the reactor reached 4.3 to 4.9 g l−1 in terms of MLVSS in the last month of the treatment. The biogas production increased with the increase of the loading rate to reach an average of 28 l after 140 days. The average content of the biogas in methane was practically constant at 70%. The treated wastewater could be considered non phytotoxic since the germination index of Lepidium sativum ranged between 60 and 87%. The quality of the treated wastewater fits largely with Tunisian norm NT 106.03 and World Health Organization Guidelines for the microbiological quality of treated wastewater used in agriculture. However, this treated wastewater should undergo further processes to reduce its contents in residual nitrogen and phosphate and thus to conform with the Tunisian standards NT 106.02, a requirement for acceptance in hydraulic public domain.
0	Abstract   In this study, a novel graphene nanoplates (GNPs) incorporated polyether block amide (PEBA) membrane was successfully prepared to be used for seawater desalination. Pervaporative desalination performances were performed in a temperature range of 35–65 °C. Effects of GNPs content in PEBA, membrane thickness, and temperature were evaluated in terms of the flux and total salt rejection. The long-term stabilities of the membranes were experimented. Incorporating graphene nanoplate into PEBA matrix enhanced flux and ion rejections simultaneously. Experimental stability of the membrane was improved by GNPs incorporation. Graphene incorporated membranes showed excellent seawater desalination performance with the salt rejection of &gt; 99.89% and flux of &gt; 2.58 kg/m2·h. Based on the flux and rejection results, optimum GNPs contents in PEBA matrix were observed as 2 wt% GNPs and 3 wt% GNPs. Increasing temperatures improved the water flux and did not significantly affect the salt rejection. The highest salt rejection was obtained as 99.94% with a flux of 2.58 kg/m2·h at 35 °C when the 3 wt% GNPs incorporated membrane was used. The nanohybrid membrane preserved 99.8% of its performance during 60 h, while the rejection performance of the pristine membrane decreased to 96.8%.
0	Mass densities, relative dielectric constants, and piezoelectric material parameters were determined on single crystals of LGS, LGN, and LGT grown with high structural perfection by the Czochralski technique. Optimized values of the elastic stiffnesses and elastic compliances were derived by measuring and critically comparing the propagation velocities of both bulk (BAW) and surface acoustic waves (SAW).
0	Abstract   Cubic GaN films were grown on Si (0 0 1) coated with an ultra-thin flat SiC buffer layer under both Ga-rich and N-rich conditions. The SiC buffer layer (thickness of about 2.5 nm) was grown by carbonization of Si (0 0 1) substrates in C 2 H 2  (pressure of 5×10 −6  Torr) at 970°C. The GaN films prepared under the Ga-rich condition had a local atomically smooth surface. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed that the main defects in the GaN films are stacking faults along the [   1    1      1&gt;   ] and [   1    1      1&gt;    1   ] directions. Plan-view TEM showed that the dislocation density within grains was much lower than the overall dislocation density in the GaN films. The dislocation density within grains was about 4×10 5  cm −2 . X-ray diffraction (XRD) and TEM showed that the GaN films had a mosaic structure. The full-width at half-maximum of the (0 0 2) XRD peak of a 0.82-μm-thick film was 19 min, one of the lowest values reported so far for cubic GaN films. And the GaN films prepared under both Ga-rich and N-rich conditions showed a strong near-band-edge photoluminescence. Yellow-band luminescence and donor–acceptor recombination peaks were also detected when the GaN films contained more extended defects and/or native-point defects.
0	We synthesized diethylamido tantalum (EtN=Ta(NEt2)3+Ta(NEt2)4) and diethylamido hafnium (Hf(NEt2)4), using nearly identical methods, as precursors for Ta- and Hf-compound films. Both precursors were liquid at room temperature and had vapor pressure (Ta: 6 Torr at 601C, Hf: 7.5 Torr at 801C) moderate enough for chemical vapor deposition (CVD). We deposited TaN thin films from diethylamido Ta and HfO2 thin films from Hf(NEt2)4/O2 using metal-organic CVD. The TaN films were amorphous and the HfO2 films were polycrystalline. Both types had goodquality step coverage. r 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The crystals were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction and transmission electronic microscopy. It was shown that the product is pure Ni 2 P which crystallizes very well with an average size of about 80 nm.
0	Abstract   We have used photoreflectance (PR) and photoluminescence (PL) measurements to characterize the optical properties of a series of strained      In    x      Ga    1  -  x      As    1  -  y      N    y      thin films    (  x  ∼  20  %  ,  y  ∼  3  %  )    grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) on different GaAs substrates with the following surface orientations: (1 0 0), (5 1 1)A, (4 1 1)A, (3 1 1)A, and (1 1 1)A. The aim of our work is to investigate the effect of substrate orientation on the optical emission of    (  In  ,  Ga  )  (  As  ,  N  )   . Our results indicate that the growth direction affects the crystal quality, the N incorporation, and the optical properties of the films.
0	Single crystals of Zn1−xCrxTe were grown by vapour phase growth method in the composition range of 0⩽x⩽0.005. Chemical analysis, surface morphology, structural and microhardness studies were carried out by EDAX, SEM, XRD and Vicker's indentation techniques, respectively. Microscopic variations between the target and actual compositions were noticed. Morphology studies revealed that dislocation aided growth is active in the present crystals. XRD studies showed that samples of all compositions crystallized in zinc blende structure, and the lattice parameters varied linearly with x following Vegard's law. Vicker's hardness (Hv) decreased exponentially with x.
0	Abstract   The low-temperature chemical vapor deposition process of silicon carbide (SiC) on an aluminum surface was developed. In order to prepare the reactive substrate surface, a silicon interlayer containing silicon dimers at its surface was formed using trichlorosilane gas at 600 °C. Next, the SiC thin film was formed at room temperature using monomethylsilane gas. Silicon, carbon and silicon-carbon bond in the obtained film were detected by various evaluations. The SiC film was amorphous and about 5-nm thick.
0	Abstract   To reduce the number of threading dislocations (TDs) in nonpolar  a -plane GaN ( a -GaN) epi-layers grown on flat  r -plane sapphire substrates ( r -FSS), we investigated the effects on the crystalline quality of the  a -GaN epi-layers of high-density patterned  r -plane sapphire substrates ( r -HPSS), the patterns of which were placed at intervals of several hundred nanometers. Two types of  r -HPSS, the patterns of which had diameters and heights on the order of several hundred nanometers ( r -NHPSS) or several micrometers ( r -MHPSS), were prepared with conventional  r -FSS. The effect of these  r -HPSS on the  a -GaN epi-layers was demonstrated by evaluating the surface morphology and the crystalline quality of the epi-layers. The surfaces of the  a -GaN epi-layer grown on  r -FSS and  r -NHPSS were pit-free and mirror-like, whereas the surface of the  a -GaN epi-layer grown on  r -MHPSS was very rough due to the large, irregular GaN islands that grew on the patterns, mainly at the initial growth stage. The crystalline quality of the  a -GaN epi-layer grown on  r -NHPSS was better than that of the  a -GaN epi-layer grown on  r -FSS. We confirmed that there were fewer TDs in the  a -GaN epi-layer grown on  r -NHPSS than there were in the  a -GaN epi-layer grown on  r -FSS. The TDs propagating to the surface in  a -GaN epi-layer grown on  r -NHPSS were mainly generated on the flat sapphire regions between the patterns. Interestingly, it was also found that the TDs that propagated to the surface concentrated with a periodic pitch along the  c -axis direction. The TD densities of  a -GaN epi-layers grown on  r -FSS and  r -NHPSS were estimated to be approximately 5.0 × 10 10  and 1.5 × 10 9  cm −2 , respectively. This knowledge will contribute to the further development of  a -GaN epi-layers for high-performance devices.
0	Abstract   Beating is the most significant process in papermaking technique that can modify the fiber morphology, sheet-formation ability of fiber suspension and properties of the wet-laid mat. In this paper, flame attenuated glass wool was beaten in water at various revolutions, ranging from 1500r to 12000r. Compared to suspensions beaten at 0r and 1500r where glass fibers simply aggregated in water, glass wool suspensions beaten at 3000r to 8000r were homogeneous with separated and randomly arranged glass fibers. Further, suspensions beaten at revolutions above 8000r were uniform but with a few broken glass fibers. The dewatering characteristics of fiber suspensions were analyzed based on fiber plugging model. Drainage resistances of flame attenuated glass wool suspension increased dramatically from 22 °SR (unbeaten) to 29 °SR (at 1500r) and then maintained at this value till 12000r. Density and porosity of the fabricated wet-laid mat was 95 kg/m 3  and 94%, respectively. Maximum tensile strength of 170 N/m for the wet-laid mat was achieved at 8000r, which then decreased significantly to 100 N/m when the revolutions exceed 10000r.
1	For a dry powder formulation platform to be suitable for pulmonary delivery of potent biopharmaceuticals, e.g., proteins and peptides, it has to be not only efficiently and reproducibly aerosolisable, but also capable of creating a matrix suitable for stabilising the relevant biomacromolecules at temperatures appropriate for storage and distribution. This study systematically evaluated the use of excipient compounds covering a range of molecular sizes: i.e., from polyol (mannitol) and disaccharide (trehalose), to polysaccharide (inulin) and synthetic polymer (PVP K30), in conjunction with other small molecule excipients. It is recognised that larger molecular weight excipients with higher Tg values are less prone to recrystallisation, however there is limited data around the potential for the inclusion of these compounds in inhalable dry powder delivery systems, where historically the focus has been on employing mono- or disaccharides. The results demonstrated that the polymer/leucine systems retained an appropriately high Tg in spite of the relatively high moisture content after spray-drying. The results also showed that sodium citrate, in contrast to glycine and leucine, was effective in inhibiting crystallisation of spray-dried mannitol. The findings demonstrated the synergistic benefits achieved from the concurrent use of several excipients on spray-dried mannitol which have not been previously reported: leucine as a particle formation agent, sodium citrate as a glass-forming agent, and glycine as a morphological modifier.
0	Abstract   The dual concept of surface energy formally allows application of Gibbs thermodynamics to the surface tension of solids and is unlimited using the classical Lippmann equation for solids that is shown to contradict all available in situ experimental data. At present, the generalized Lippmann equation is believed to be the most universal, since the classical Lippmann equation, the Shuttleworth and Gokhshtein equations could be derived from it. Lately it was evaluated in two opposite ways: the first—the experimental verification of the Gokhshtein equation supports correctness of the generalized Lippmann and Shuttleworth equations; the second—the incompatibility of the Shuttleworth equation with Hermann's mathematical structure of thermodynamics makes invalid all its corollaries, including the generalized Lippmann and Gokhshtein equations. Both approaches are shown here to be incorrect, since the Gokhshtein equation cannot be correctly derived from any of the above-mentioned equations.  The Frumkin derivation of the first and second Gokhshtein equations follows from one thermodynamic relationship general for the surface tension of both solid and liquid electrodes. The classical Lippmann equation is also derived from this general relationship as a particular case of the second Gokhshtein equations. We have considered the hierarchy of these equations and discussed the straightforward application of the classical Lippmann equation for solids with an account for elasticity of the surface structured layers of liquids.  The partial charge transfer during anion adsorption cannot be measured in electrochemical experiments or reliably estimated by quantum-chemical and DFT calculations. However, it is directly involved in the adsorbate charge that is experimentally accessible by in situ contact electric resistance technique. We present the first quantitative evaluation of charge transfer during halides adsorption on silver from aqueous solutions in dependence on the electrode potential.
0	Abstract   Over the last decade, numerous biopolymers have received more attention in medical applications involving novel biomaterials because of their biocompatibility, biodegradability, and ease of processing. To date, many biopolymer-based functional composites have been developed to increase the value of raw biopolymers obtained from natural sources or microbial systems. This review article covers general information on various biopolymers, important methods for biopolymer-based composites preparation including their advantages and disadvantages, and surface topography for tissue engineering. In addition, this article provides comprehensive knowledge and highlights recent research on functional biopolymer composites used in various medical applications, such as tissue engineering comprising skin, bone, cartilage, vascular graft, and other organs, implantable medical devices including stent and barrier membrane, and some delivery systems of bioactive agents. Furthermore, the article presents a brief overview on several challenges and future scope in this field.
0	Abstract   Nanolayer composite coatings enable creation of stable structures with unique properties, and in particular, combination of properties conventionally considered excluding one another, such as high hardness and high toughness. Coatings, typically 1–4 μm thick, were deposited at a total pressure ranging from 0.9 to 3 Pa, at relatively low substrate temperatures not exceeding 200 °C. We deposited nanostructured multilayer coatings of the CN/MeNx type, where Me could be Ti, Nb or Zr. Various substrates such as, highly polished tungsten carbide, steel and silicon were used. This study concentrated on the tribological properties of CN/MeNx nanostructured multilayers. The friction coefficient, wear and the film transfer in a ball-on-disk tribometer were presented. The samples were measured after the deposition and then thermally treated at a constant temperature in the air. Afterwards, the samples were again measured and then exposed to a higher temperature, until the layer broke down. We also investigated the structure of the coating by means of low-angle X-ray reflection and high-angle X-ray diffraction. The potential application of CN/MeNx nanolayer composites as hard solid lubricant is discussed.
0	Atomic-scale dynamics in thermal oxidation on Si(001) has been investigated by employing the reflectance difference (RD) oscillation technique. After reviewing the RD spectra reported for oxidized single-domain Si(001) surfaces, we report the results of dynamic measurements, which were carried out using a GaN semiconductor laser as the light source. RD traces show distinctly different behaviors depending on whether oxidation is in the passive (oxide growth) or active (etching) mode. The critical temperature-pressure conditions for onset of oxide growth have been identified. When oxide growth is continued to the second and subsequent layers, the RD amplitude shows oscillation from which we have extracted layer-specific kinetic parameters for the oxidation process.
1	Critical thickness theory explains an excess yield stress in thin films inversely proportional to the film thickness. However, in other contexts, an excess yield stress is often observed which is proportional to the inverse square-root of a relevant dimension. Work-hardening coefficients show both inverse and inverse square-root behaviours. We review recent experimental work which has demonstrated these effects unambiguously, and discuss the extent to which they can be theoretically understood.
0	Abstract   We prepare polycrystalline CuCrO 2  and CuCr 0.98 Ni 0.02 O 2  samples by solid state reaction and investigate their multiferroicity. It is revealed that the Ni-doping can not only enhance slightly magnetization but also improve ferroelectricity. It is argued that the Ni 3+ -doping destabilizes the antiferromagnetic order of Cr 3+  ions and modulates the spin configuration, leading to the weak ferromagnetism and enhanced ferroelectric polarization. The coupling between the magnetic order and ferroelectric order is also characterized.
0	article i nfo Available online 1 April 2011 Measurements of the electrical resistivity (ρ), Seebeck coefficient (S), and thermal conductivity (κ) on the rare earth ternary intermetallic YMn4Al8 has been performed in the temperature range 10-300 K to investigate the electronic structure and the possible existence of pseudogap. YMn4Al8, with linear chains of Mn atoms, is an itinerant electron magnet that has a narrow pseudogap in the spin excitation spectrum. For comparison, the nonmagnetic counterpart YCu4Al8 has also been studied. It is found that the replacement of Cu for Mn leads to a dramatic increase in the electrical conductivity, indicating an increased metallic nature of YCu4Al8. The evident difference in the magnitude of the Seebeck coefficient between YMn4Al8 and YCu4Al8 as well as the sign reversal of S(T) in YCu4Al8 suggest that the Fermi level in YMn4Al8 is located within a rapidly varying density of states (DOS)/pseudogap and a significant change in temperature dependent DOS is taking place. A detailed analysis of the thermal conductivity by separating lattice and electronic contribution and the comparison with the electrical resistivity indicates a more ordered and increased metallic state for YCu4Al8 than that of YMn4Al8.
0	Abstract   Growth of vertical, multiwalled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) on bulk copper foil substrates can be achieved by sputtering either Ni or Inconel thin films on Cu substrates followed by thermal chemical vapor deposition using a xylene and ferrocene mixture. During CVD growth, Fe nanoparticles from the ferrocene act as a vapor phase delivered catalyst in addition to the transition metal thin film, which breaks up into islands. Both the thin film and iron are needed for dense and uniform growth of CNTs on the copper substrates. The benefits of this relatively simple and cost effective method of directly integrating CNTs with highly conductive copper substrates are the resulting high density of nanotubes that do not require the use of additional binders and the potential for low contact resistance between the nanotubes and the substrate. This method is therefore of interest for charge storage applications such as double layer capacitors. Inconel thin films in conjunction with Fe from ferrocene appear to work better in comparison to Ni thin films in terms of CNT density and charge storage capability. We report here the power density and specific capacitance values of the double layer capacitors developed from the CNTs grown directly on copper substrates.
0	Abstract   (Ag w Cu 1 − w )(In 1 − x Ga x )Se 2  alloy absorber layers with w ≈ 0.8 and x ≈ 0.78 ratios were deposited using multi-source elemental evaporation and analyzed by glancing incidence X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy combined with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The effect of Rapid Thermal Processing (RTP) on the structure and composition of the near-surface layers was investigated. It was found that the RTP doesn't have a noticeable effect on the grain size and roughness of the film surface. On the other hand, additional reflections of the films with 0.5 ≤ Ga/(Ga + In)   0.5, due to an ordered defect phase which is confined to the near-surface region of the film, are completely diminished after RTP with excess Se present. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results show that RTP with excess Se present altered the distribution of elements, rendering the film surface less group I deficient after that process. Consequently, atomic ratios were changed from the composition of I 1 III 5 VI 8  compound to the composition close to that of I 1 III 3 VI 5  ordered defect phase. Additionally, the RTP treatment, especially with excess Se, significantly enhanced solar cell efficiency performance due to an improvement in the open circuit voltage.
0	Abstract   Metallic nanolayered thin films/foils, in particular Ni/Al multilayers, have been used to promote joining. The objective of this work is to evaluate the thermal stability of nanoscale metallic multilayers with potential for joining applications. Multilayers thin films with low (Ti/Al and Ni/Ti), medium (Ni/Al) and high (Pd/Al) enthalpies of exothermic reaction were prepared by dual cathode magnetron sputtering. Their thermal stability was studied by: i) differential scanning calorimetry combined with X-ray diffraction (XRD), ii) in-situ XRD using cobalt radiation, and iii) in-situ transmission electron microscopy. It was possible to detect traces of intermetallic or amorphous phases in the as-deposited short period (bilayer thickness) multilayers, except for the Ti/Al films where no reaction products that might be formed during deposition were identified. For short periods (below 20 nm) the equilibrium phases are directly achieved upon annealing, whereas for higher periods intermediate trialuminide phases are present for Ti/Al and Ni/Al multilayers. The formation of B2-NiTi from Ni/Ti multilayers occurs without the formation of intermediate phases. On the contrary, for the Pd–Al system the formation of intermediate phases was never avoided.  The viability of nanoscale multilayers as “filler” materials for joining macro or microparts/devices was demonstrated.
0	Abstract   This work aims to explore the effects of Sr + 2  concentrations on the growth of SrTiO 3  thin films synthesized by the hydrothermal–galvanic couple method. The syntheses were conducted on the TiN/Si substrates in 2 M NaOH solutions consisting of various Sr + 2  concentrations at 80 °C. Cubic SrTiO 3  films were formed at Sr + 2  concentrations above 0.0004 M. Epitaxial-like growth of the SrTiO 3  films was found over the TiN underlayer at such various Sr + 2  concentrations. The relative diffraction peak intensity, the grain size, and the thickness of the obtained SrTiO 3  films first increased rapidly, then reached the maximum, and decreased gradually afterwards with increasing the Sr + 2  concentrations. The grain size and the thickness of the films would reach the maximum at 0.001 M [Sr + 2 ]. Nanograins of the films were present at high Sr + 2  concentrations. The growth kinetics of the films was determined by a modified Avrami–Erofe'ev equation. Nucleation governs the formation of SrTiO 3  at high Sr + 2  concentrations, leading to the nanograins. Grain growth predominates at low Sr + 2  concentrations, yielding the large grains. Moreover, both the dielectric constant and the dielectric loss of the obtained SrTiO 3  films increased with decreasing the Sr + 2  concentrations.
0	Abstract   We investigated the effect of laser fluence and spot size on the structure and composition of BiFeO 3  (BFO) epitaxial thin films grown on SrTiO 3  substrates by Pulsed Laser Deposition. X-ray diffraction shows that BFO's out of plane lattice parameter increases with the laser fluence. A coherent epitaxial film growth is observed for all tested laser fluences and spot sizes for thicknesses up to 16 nm. The critical thickness at which relaxation occurs depends either on the laser fluence or spot size. The fluence dependence of the out of plane lattice parameter is accompanied with a cationic composition variation. Bi vacancies are evidenced at lower fluences while as Bi/Fe tends towards 1 a higher relaxation critical thickness is observed. An optimum Bi/Fe ratio is obtained for a fluence of 1.72 J/cm 2 . This result was confirmed by wavelength-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (WDS) scans over a 1 cm 2  film. An excellent thickness and composition uniformity is attained over the entire sample area.
0	Abstract   Infrared glass ceramics transmitting light from 2 to 15 μm have been produced from a Ga–Ge–Sb–Se glass. The glass composition is selected in the middle of the glass forming region and the annealing temperature must be close to Tg to avoid excessive crystal growth. A heating time of the order of two weeks is necessary to see evolution of the thermal expansion coefficient of the composite while keeping the optical transmission properties of the glass.
0	Abstract   This paper is the second part of a study on bubble transport, growth and shrinkage in three-dimensional gravity driven flow. Sample calculations with applications to glass melting furnaces are presented. First, a consistent set of thermophysical properties of the most common composition (74SiO2–16Na2O–10CaO (mol%)) of soda-lime silicate glass or similar compositions over the temperature range of 1000–2000 K is reported. The population balance equation is solved for the bubble density function using the backward method of characteristics. The zeroth to third order moments, i.e., number of bubbles, average radius, molar gas fraction, interfacial area, and void fraction are computed by numerical integration. Results for both transient and steady state operations are presented and analysed. Two cases are considered (1) bubbles containing only CO2 and (2) bubbles containing a diffusing gas (O2) and a non-diffusing gas (CO2). The feasibility of such complex calculation is demonstrated and is in qualitative agreement with reported results.
0	Abstract   The formation of lead–silicate coatings onto the surface of silica glass after its treatment in molten mixtures of Pb(NO3)2–KNO3 and Pb(NO3)2–Cu(NO3)2–KNO3 at 420–520 °C was investigated. The coating formation was supported by the appearance and adsorption/sedimentation of lead–oxide cations and nano-particles, from the salt melt, onto the treated glass surface. These particles, deposited onto the substrate, interacted with the structure of silica glass and formed an amorphous lead–silicate coating exhibiting a chemical composition gradient from PbO to SiO2. The admixture of Cu(NO3)2 in the abovementioned salt mixture favored higher rates of lead oxide sedimentation (co-sedimentation with copper oxide). The external potion of this coating was progressively crystallized during treatment in the molten mixture of Pb(NO3)2–Cu(NO3)2–KNO3 due to the nucleation of Cu2O crystals supporting the formation of Pb8Cu(Si2O7)3, Pb3O4 and 2PbO · SiO2.
0	Abstract   Through the extraction reaction of hydrogen atoms of methylene group of trifluoroacetylacetone (TFA) has been functionalized by a novel crosslinking reagent was firstly modified by 3-(triethylsilyl)-propyl-isocyanate (TEPIC), the double reactive molecular bridge (TFASi) has been achieved. Subsequently, using its carbonyl oxygen atom of amide group coordinated to terbium ions, the luminescent terbium molecular-based hybrids have been constructed from the cohydrolysis and copolycondensation process with the two similar alkoxy groups of both molecular bridge and tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS). The composition, structure and especially the photophysical properties of the molecular bridge and corresponding molecular-based hybrids have been discussed with a variety of spectroscopic methods (FTIR,  1 H NMR and  13 C NMR, UV, phosphorescent and luminescent spectra).
0	Abstract   The partial solvation parameters (PSP) have been defined recently, on the basis of the insight derived from modern quantum chemical calculations, in an effort to overcome some of the inherent restrictions of the original definition of solubility parameter and expand its range of applications. The present work continues along these lines and introduces two new solvation parameters, the van der Waals and the polarity/refractivity ones, which may replace both of the former dispersion and polar PSPs. Thus, one may use either the former scheme of PSPs (dispersion, polar, acidic, and basic) or, equivalently, the new scheme (van der Waals, polarity/refractivity, acidic, basic). The new definitions are made in a simple and straightforward manner and, thus, the strength and appeal of the widely accepted concept of solubility parameter is preserved. The inter-relations of the various PSPs are critically discussed and their values are tabulated for a variety of common substances. The advantage of the new scheme of PSPs is the bridge that makes with the corresponding Abraham’s LSER descriptors. With this bridge, one may exchange information between PSPs, LSER experimental scales, and quantum mechanics calculations such as via the COSMO-RS theory. The proposed scheme is a predictive one and it is applicable to, both, homo-solvated and hetero-solvated compounds. The new scheme is tested for the calculation of activity coefficients at infinite dilution, for octanol/water partition coefficients, and for the prediction of miscibility of some pharmaceuticals in various solvents. The perspectives from bridging LSER and solubility parameter approaches are discussed.
1	Abstract   The solubility of pronamide in five organic solvents (ethanol, methanol, isopropanol, toluene and cyclohexane) at the temperature range from (278.15 to 323.15) K was measured by a dynamic equilibrium method. The results showed that the solubility of pronamide increased with the increasing temperature in all the solvents involved. The experimental values were correlated by the Apelblat equation, and a good fitting result was confirmed by the low level of root-mean-square deviations ( −4 ). Moreover, the apparent dissolving enthalpies and entropies, were derived from simplified van’t Hoff equation. The positive values of enthalpies and entropies revealed that the dissolution of pronamide in the selected solvents was an endothermic and entropy-driven process.
1	Proposing an implicit unconditionally stable time integration method.Using quartic B-spline basis function.Good accuracy compared to the methods in the literature.The scheme can achieve lower numerical amplitude dissipation and period dispersion. In Ref. 1] an effective conditionally stable explicit time integration scheme using quartic B-spline function was proposed for solving the problems in structural dynamics. The current paper presents a scheme where this method is developed to an implicit unconditionally stable time integration method. Using quartic B-spline basis function, this method gained second order of acceleration at each time-step. In this research, in order to applying the stabilization process, first, a series of implicit standard formulas were derived from previous formulation. Then after inserting two controlling parameters γ and β in the standard formulas, unconditional stability is guaranteed.
1	This paper describes a procedure for calculating the dynamic stiffness matrix of tubular shells with free edge boundary conditions. Such an analysis forms the basis for the Continuous Element Method. The method is used to formulate a thick axisymmetric shell element which takes into account rotatory inertia, transverse shear deformation and non-axisymmetric loadings.
0	Using hyperelastic materials and unstructured mesh, a level set based topological shape optimization method is developed for geometrically nonlinear structures in total Lagrangian framework. In the level set method, the initial domain is kept fixed and its boundary is represented by an implicit moving boundary embedded in a level set function, which facilitates to handle complicated topological shape changes and eventually leads the initial implicit boundary to an optimal one according to the normal velocity field while both minimizing the objective function of instantaneous structural compliance and satisfying an allowable material volume constraint. In existing level set based methods, an initial reference domain or an ersatz material is employed for the penalization of whole domain to represent the current domain. However, these approaches end up with a convergence difficulty in nonlinear response analysis due to the inaccurate tangent stiffness. To overcome this difficulty, taking advantage of the obtained level set function, the current structural boundary is actually represented using a Delaunay triangulation scheme and a hyperelastic material law is employed to handle the large strain problem. The required velocity field in the actual domain to update the level set equation is determined from the descent direction of Lagrangian derived from optimality conditions. The velocity field outside the actual domain is determined through a velocity extension scheme based on a fast marching method. Since homogeneous material property and actual boundary are utilized, the convergence difficulty is significantly relieved.
1	Tensegrities consist of disjoint struts connected by tensile strings which maintain shape due to pre-stress stability. Because of their rigidity, foldability and deployability, tensegrities are becoming increasingly popular in engineering. Unfortunately few effective analytical methods for discovering tensegrity geometries exist. We introduce an evolutionary algorithm which produces large tensegrity structures, and demonstrate its efficacy and scalability relative to previous methods. A generative representation allows the discovery of underlying structural patterns. These techniques have produced the largest and most complex irregular tensegrities known in the field, paving the way toward novel solutions ranging from space antennas to soft robotics.
0	Abstract   The tendency to electrostatic charge is at least an unpleasant property, which is unfortunately typical for many floors. Ionic liquids represent a good alternative to overcome the disadvantages from typical antistatic agents like worse leaching behavior and at least haze in the coating. 1-Allyl-3-alkyllimidazolium salts have been evaluated as antistatic additives in a UV-curing coating for parquet flooring. 1-Allyl-3-methyllimidazolium chloride has been identified to exhibit the highest activity and a minimized leaching. The measured body voltage regarding EN 1815 was below ≤2.0 kV and the resistivity regarding EN 1081 below 10 10  Ω. In addition, there is a synergistic effect with conductive and transparent indium-tin-oxide pigment particles.
1	Abstract   The Arlequin method is a generic numerical method that allows, by local superposition and coupling of models, to address multimodel and multiscale mechanical problems. In particular, this method has already been used to super-impose cracked patches on sound structures, reducing this way the global simulation resources a classical finite element approach would have required.  In this paper, one of the key features of the extended-finite element method, namely the heaviside enrichment function, is used within the Arlequin framework to further reduce the costs of crack propagation simulations. The main goal of the paper is to describe the proposed methodology and to assess its performance through numerical experiments.
0	Abstract   Despite the advances in computer power and numerical algorithms over the last decades, solutions to unsteady flow problems remain computing time intensive. Especially for high Reynolds number flows, nonlinear multigrid, which is commonly used to solve the nonlinear systems of equations, converges slowly. The stiffness induced by the high-aspect ratio cells and turbulence is not tackled well by this solution method.  In this paper, it is investigated if a Jacobian-free Newton–Krylov ( jfnk ) solution method can speed up unsteady flow computations at high Reynolds numbers. Preconditioning of the linear systems that arise after Newton linearization is commonly performed with matrix-free preconditioners or approximate factorizations based on crude approximations of the Jacobian. Approximate factorizations based on a Jacobian that matches the target residual operator are unpopular because these preconditioners consume a large amount of memory and can suffer from robustness issues. However, these preconditioners remain appealing because they closely resemble       A    -  1      .  In this paper, it is shown that a  jfnk  solution method with an approximate factorization preconditioner based on a Jacobian that approximately matches the target residual operator enables a speed up of a factor 2.5–12 over nonlinear multigrid for two-dimensional high Reynolds number flows. The solution method performs equally well as nonlinear multigrid for three-dimensional laminar problems. A modest memory consumption is achieved with partly lumping the Jacobian before constructing the approximate factorization preconditioner, whereas robustness is ensured with enhanced diagonal dominance.
0	Abstract   This attempt addresses the simultaneous characteristics of thermal radiation and melting heat transfer effects in stagnation point flow of carbon nanotubes due to a stretching cylinder. Velocity slip phenomenon is also retained. Two types of carbon nanotubes (single and multi-walls) are homogeneously dispersed in the base fluid (water). The governing physical problem is modeled and converted into set of coupled nonlinear ODE’s utilizing transformations. Resulting problems are computed numerically by fifth order Range–Kutta Fehlberg scheme. The physical characteristics of various variables on the velocity and thermal fields are examined. Numerical data for skin friction and Nusselt number have been prepared and deliberated. It is explored that velocity is increased for larger ratio of rate constants. The increasing values of melting parameter correspond to higher velocity and less temperature. Besides this the accuracy of present results is also affirmed. It is noted that the computed numerical solutions have excellent match with previous published materials in a limiting sense.
1	Abstract   Processes involving heat transfer from a humid air stream to a cold plate, with simultaneous deposition of frost, are of great importance in a variety of refrigeration equipment. In this paper, frost growth on a cold, vertical plate in free convection has been experimentally investigated. The cold plate (0.095 m high, 0.282 m wide) was placed in vertical channels open at the top and bottom in order to permit the natural circulation of ambient air. The channels, rectangular in shape, were 2.395 m high and 0.36 m wide, with the depth set equal either to 20 mm, or 10 mm, or 6 mm in order to infer the influence of channel flow area on the natural convection and frost formation. The cold plate temperature and the air relative humidity were varied in the −40 to −4 °C and 31–85% range, respectively, with the air temperature held fixed at 27 °C (±1 °C). Several quantities (thickness, temperature and mass of frost, heat flux at the cold plate), were measured during the time-evolution of the process (7.5 h from the frost growth inception), and are presented as functions of the input parameters (relative humidity and cold plate temperature); in particular, the role exerted by the plate confinement on the frost growth is discussed. Data are recast in order to identify compact parameters able to correlate frost mass, thickness and density data.
0	In the current work we propose a multiphase DNS method capable of resolving the motion of solid particles coupled with heat transfer effects. The method is based on solving a shared set of momentum and energy balance equations for the carrier phase and the particulate phase. Individual#R##N#particles are tracked using a number of volume fraction advection equations. The proposed method is in very good agreement with the available data in the literature for the following cases: isothermal particle motion (in the presence of walls and other particles), natural convection around a stationary particle and solid particles motion accompanied with heat transfer effects. In addition, we show that the method is inherently capable of handling deformable particles (i.e. droplets and bubbles) coexisting#R##N#with solid particles. The method is thus well suited to deal with challenging multiphase systems, such as diesel spray combustion with soot formation, spray drying with particle nucleation, biological treatment of waste water etc.
1	We investigate the temperature dependence of the order parameters of the Blume–Capel model for zero magnetic field in the lowest approximation of the cluster variation method which is identical to the mean-field approximation. Besides the stable branches of the order parameters, we establish the metastable and unstable parts of these curves for the various values of the coupling parameter, α=D/J. We also study the dynamics of the model by the path probability method, since the metastable behavior is a dynamical behavior. From this study, the “flatness” property of metastable states, “overshooting” phenomenon and as well as the role of the unstable state are seen explicitly. On the other hand, we also investigate how to obtain the metastable phases with two long-range order parameters. Finally, we calculate the phase transitions of the metastable and unstable branches of order parameters besides the stable branches and present the complete phase diagram.
1	The sequences of bases A, T, C and G of about 100 enolase, secA and cytochrome DNA were analyzed for attractive or repulsive interactions by the numbers T1,T2,T3;r of nearest, next-nearest and third neighbor bases of the same kind and the concentration r=other bases/analyzed base. The area of possible T1,T2 values is limited by the linear borders T2=2T1−2,T2=0 or T1=0 for clustering, attractive or repulsive interactions and the border T2=−2T1+2(2−r) for a variation from repulsive to attractive interactions at r⩽2. Clustering is preferred by most bases in sequences of enolases and secA’s. Major deviations with repulsive interactions of some bases are observed for archaea bacteria in secA and for highly developed animals and the human species in enolase sequences. The borders of the structure map for enthalpy stabilized structures with maximum interactions are approached in few cases. Most letters of the natural languages and some music notes are at the borders of the structure map.
1	The dynamics of a stock market with heterogeneous agents is discussed in the framework of a recently proposed spin model for the emergence of bubbles and crashes. We relate the log-returns of stock prices to magnetization in the model and find that it is closely related to trading volume as observed in real markets. The cumulative distribution of log-returns exhibits scaling with exponents steeper than 2 and scaling is observed in the distribution of transition times between bull and bear markets.
0	In previous publications by the author the crystalline state was studied with the help of statistical methods based upon utilization of distribution functions. The approximation used for a crystal was not, however, fully adequate for fluids, which did not permit one, in particular, to construct a phase diagram with a triple and critical point. The present paper begins with analysis of the pair correlation function in crystals in order to find an approximation adequate for a crystal as well as fluid. The relevant thermodynamics is developed. It is shown that the fluid can be described, for example, by the hypernetted-chain equation or by the van der Waals or Dieterici equations of state, and such a description will be compatible with the proposed description of the crystal. A phase diagram is constructed which exhibits the region of the crystalline state together with the triple and critical points.
1	We study the dynamical behavior of vehicular traffic through a sequence of traffic lights positioned self-similarly on a highway, where all traffic lights turn on and off simultaneously with cycle time Ts. The signals are positioned self-similarly by Cantor set. The nonlinear-map model of vehicular traffic controlled by self-similar signals is presented. The vehicle exhibits the complex behavior with varying cycle time. The tour time is much lower such that signals are positioned periodically with the same interval. The arrival time T(x) at position x scales as (T(x)-x)∝xdf, where df is the fractal dimension of Cantor set. The landscape in the plot of T(x)−x against cycle time Ts shows a self-affine fractal with roughness exponent α=1−df.
1	Abstract   This paper presents a novel approach for developing a closed form solution for a lightning generated electric field which uses a modified double exponential base-current waveform. In the literature, several models have employed the square pulse waveform to derive the corresponding electromagnetic fields. However, given the Department of Defense (DoD) has incorporated the double exponential current waveform as part of their “Electromagnetic Environmental Effects Requirements For Systems”, it is noteworthy to develop a solution for the electric field which utilizes this waveform. In order to facilitate the integration required for deriving the field, Taylor series expansion will be used for all variable dependent exponential terms within the current waveform. This methodology greatly simplifies the integration required to solve for the electric field in an approximated closed form. However, by utilizing Taylor series to approximate the variable dependent exponentials, the electric field’s accuracy becomes a function of the number of terms used. Consequently, a correction factor will need to be added in order to help reshape the electric field which resulted from the modified base-current waveform.
1	Abstract   The effect of microbial easily degradable substrate (MEDS) on the anaerobic degradation of pentachlorophenol (PCP) in two upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactors was investigated. The results indicated that glucose-utilizing activity decreased with the increase of PCP concentration in the mixed culture, and MEDS promoted PCP-dechlorination and degrading activities. The concentration of MEDS increased from 917 to 4580 mg L−1 with the increase of PCP concentration from 100 to 181 mg L−1in influent, which was necessary for maintenance of steady operation of the experimental reactors, the removal rate of PCP and COD ranged up to 99.5 and 90.0% and the concentration of PCP in the effluent was less than 0.5 mg L−1. The concentration of PCP in effluent was linearly or logarithmically related to sucrose concentration in the influent while PCP was less than the maximum permissible PCP concentration. The activity of anaerobic sludge in the reactor decreased as the concentration of PCP increased, but it could be recovered step by step as time progressed. In the lowest layer of the reactor, the activity of sludge was the highest. So it is feasible to accelerate the degradation of the organic toxic compounds like PCP, by adding suitable quantities of microbial easily degradable substrate to the system.
1	The behaviour of vertical commercial propane jet fires (flame lengths of up to 8m) was studied experimentally. The temperatures along the jet fire centreline were measured using a set of thermocouples and the flame contour was determined from infra-red (IR) images. The results show that temperature increases from the bottom of the flame, reaches a maximum value and decreases again at the top zone. A second-degree polynomial expression describes fairly well the variation of temperature as a function of the position on the flame centreline. The temperature along the centreline was found to increase for Q values lower than 7MW and to decrease at higher values. Language: en
1	Abstract   Triclocarban (TCC) is an emerging and persistent pollutant once released into environment. In this study, TCC-degrading Ochrobactrum sp. MC22, was isolated and characterized. This is the first report on plant-growth promoting bacterium with versatile capability of TCC degradation under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. The aerobic degradation of TCC occurred completely of which the kinetic analysis revealed a non-self-inhibitive substrate effect, and broad-concentration-range degradation efficiency (ranging from 0.16–30 mg L−1). Anaerobic TCC degradation was feasible, but was significantly enhanced up to 40–50% when ferric, or acetate was provided as electron donor, or acceptor, respectively. TCC biodegradation under both conditions was proposed to initially occur through hydrolysis leading to transient accumulation of chloroanilines, which could be completely metabolized and detoxified. With concern on TCC adverse effect to plants, role of MC22 on toxicity mitigation was investigated using two legume plants: Vigna radiata and Glycine max (L.) Merr. Upon TCC exposure, damage of both plant structures, especially root system was observed, but was substantially mitigated by MC22 bioaugmentation. This study not only provides thorough TCC degradation characteristic and kinetics of MC22, but also suggests a potential role of this bacterial strain for a rhizoremediation in crop area with TCC contamination.
1	Abstract   We present the results of an experimental study of isodense displacement of a yield stress viscoplastic fluid by a miscible Newtonian one in a horizontal pipe. A central type displacement flow develops for the configuration given. Three distinct flow types belonging to this central displacement are identified namely corrugated, wavy and smooth depending on the level of the residual layer variation along the pipe. The transition between these flow regimes is found to be a function of the Reynolds number defined as the ratio of the inertial stress to the characteristic viscous stress of the viscoplastic fluid.
0	Abstract   To explore a more function-stable and energy-efficient bipolar membrane, palygorskite and FeCl 3  were added at the intermediate layer as water-splitting catalysts. As proven, the two materials have a synergetic effect on water splitting. Particularly, the bipolar membrane modified with 5 g dm −3  palygorskite and 0.005 mol dm −3  FeCl 3  can achieve a voltage drop of 0.68 V at 100 mA cm −2  and loses only 14.7 μg of Fe after an electrodialysis operation at 100 mA cm −2  for 660 min. Obviously, palygorskite can protect ferric ions from significant loss, which makes the membrane stable in the performance of water splitting. Nevertheless, how palygorskite immobilizes ferric ions is still under investigation.
0	Abstract   Novel synthetic ion-exchange membranes composed of 4-vinylbenzyl chloride, styrene, and ethylmethacrylate were synthesized by radical polymerization using various monomer ratios. Copolymers with the desired molecular weights were successfully synthesized (Mn&gt;39.5×10 3  g/mol, Mw&gt;52.8×10 3  g/mol). After the radical polymerization, the ion-exchange membranes were prepared through amination and heat curing. The chemical structures of the membranes were characterized using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and  1 H and  13 C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The thermal, electrical, and other basic properties of the membranes, including water uptake and ion-exchange capacities, were measured. The glass temperature values of the polymers ranged from 67.5 to 81.2 °C. The nitrate permeation properties were also investigated by applying the membranes in a capacitive deionization system. Compared to conventional membranes, the nitrate concentrations in the cyclical charge and discharge currents indicated that the synthesized membranes were more efficient.
1	This paper studies the effects of strain sources at depth, simulating volcanic source activation, on the changes of Coulomb failure stress in the surrounding volume. Such simulations are aimed at clarifying the relationship between volcano dynamics and seismicity generated by stress changes. The effect of isotropic overpressure or dike opening on the Coulomb stress patterns is shown here, in presence of a background tectonic stress. Seismicity patterns resulting from such stress changes can thus be used to shed light on the sources involved. Simulations of Coulomb stress changes associated to the opening of the Northeast rifts at Kilauea volcano (Hawaii) have been performed, showing that seismicity at this area is well explained by stress changes produced by rift opening (i.e. without any contribution out of local sources), both in terms of location patterns and focal mechanisms. In particular, the widely observed focusing of seismicity in the southern flank can be explained in terms of Coulomb stress changes generated by rift opening, once the different opposing masses in the northern and southern flank is taken into account. In addition, Coulomb stress changes due to rift opening are shown to explain both the occurrence of large earthquakes and of the seaward sliding of the Southern flank, on the low-angle reverse faults hypothesized at the base of the rift zone.
1	The Larderello geothermal field is located in the inner Northern Apennines (southern Tuscany), an area which has been affected by extensional tectonics since the Early–Middle Miocene. The structure of the Larderello field is characterised by NW-trending, NE-dipping Pliocene to Present normal faults. Their geometry down to depths of 4–5 km is constrained by field, borehole, and reflection seismic data. An association between extensional structures and heat flow maxima (up to 1000 mW/m2) is recognisable from detailed surface heat flow mapping. In order to investigate the relationships among extensional structures and heat flow, subsurface isotherms were traced, subject to borehole control, along variously oriented geological cross-sections. The isotherms show vertical displacements associated with the recent normal faults and related deformation zones, which reach the brittle/ductile transition. Estimates of the relative importance of convective and conductive components of heat flow suggest that fluid circulation is particularly important in correspondence with the normal faults, accounting for the correlation between isotherm perturbations and extensional structures. In this view, extensional shear zones are interpreted as the main structural pathways for the flow of hot geothermal fluids.
1	Abstract   At all stages of pavement life, the highway surface should have some sort of roughness to facilitate friction between car wheels and pavement surface. Skid resistance is a measure of the resistance of pavement surface to sliding or skidding of the vehicle. It is a relationship between the vertical force and the horizontal force developed as a tire slides along the pavement surface. The texture of the pavement surface and its ability to resist the polishing effect of traffic is of prime importance in providing skidding resistance. Polishing of the aggregate is the reduction in microtexture, resulting in the smoothing and rounding of exposed aggregates. This process is caused by particle wear on a microscopic scale. It is a common fact that the lower the skid resistance value, the higher the percentage of the traffic accidents, especially during the wet seasons. Having a low skid resistance value at an asphalt concrete surface might be attributed to one or more of the following reasons: (1) use of higher asphalt content than recommended by the mix design procedure, (2) the Marshall mix design procedure itself, (3) used aggregate gradation, and (4) aggregate quality. To evaluate these factors, a comparative study was performed to find the British Pendulum Skid Resistance Number for a number of mixes. These mixes included, an asphalt concrete mix using local aggregate at the optimum Marshall asphalt content, mixes with 0.5% and 1.0% asphalt contents higher than Marshall optimum asphalt content, a mix designed using Superpave design procedure, a mix with steel slag to replace 30% of limestone aggregate, and a mix with stone matrix aggregate gradation. It was found that the mix with 30% slag has the highest skid number followed by Superpave, SMA, and Marshall mixes, respectively. It was also observed that increasing the asphalt content above the optimal asphalt content value decreases the skid resistance of these mixes.
1	Abstract   Construction time has been acknowledged by construction researchers and industry practitioners over the past three decades as one of the most important performance criteria of many successful projects. This raises an increasing global concern about benchmarking best practice measures of construction time performance (CTP) for use by clients, consultants and contractors in the construction industry. Previously derived statistical time models were first reviewed in this paper. A questionnaire survey was then undertaken to identify a set of critical factors influencing construction durations of high-rise public housing projects in Hong Kong. Data were gleaned from a representative sample of 56 standard ‘Harmony’-type residential blocks via mailed standard questionnaires. Multiple regression exercises were performed to analyse the project data and establish a prediction model. The results suggested that the overall construction duration of such projects could be modelled on the basis of a set of scope factors, construction method and housing scheme chosen. Predicted durations calculated from the developed model were then compared and assessed against actual durations achieved on-site. The concept of CTP index, which represents the predicted durations of individual projects relative to their actual observed durations, was applied as a useful means for evaluating and benchmarking their CTP. Practical applications of the developed model were also explained. Another construction time prediction model is envisaged to be formulated for private sector housing blocks in Hong Kong for local and international comparisons.
1	Designing ventilation systems for buildings requires a suitable tool to assess the system performance. This investigation assessed seven types of models (analytical, empirical, small-scale experimental, full-scale experimental, multizone network, zonal, and CFD) for predicting ventilation performance in buildings, which can be different in details according to the model type. The analytical model can give an overall assessment of a ventilation system if the flow could be approximated to obtain an analytical solution. The empirical model is similar to the analytical model in terms of its capacities but is developed with a database. The small-scale model can be useful to examine complex ventilation problems if flow similarity can be maintained between the scaled model and reality. The full-scale model is the most reliable in predicting ventilation performance, but is expensive and time consuming. The multizone model is a useful tool for ventilation design in a whole building, but cannot provide detailed flow information in a room. The zonal model can be useful when a user has prior knowledge of the flow in a room. The CFD model provides the most detailed information about ventilation performance and is the most sophisticated. However, the model needs to be validated by corresponding experimental data and the user should have solid knowledge of fluid mechanics and numerical technique. Thus, the choice for an appropriate model is problem-dependent.
1	This paper describes the methodology developed and the calculation steps used to evaluate the energy efficiency potential of office buildings. The methodology enables a detailed analysis of retrofit options for the building envelope and its energy supply system. Different simplification measures accelerate the data acquisition process for office building stock owners and allow a data handling according to the existing building information, thus enabling office building structures to be prompted to design typical building constructions. We implement solutions enabling both a time-saving accelerated data input for office buildings and the handling of incomplete data. An automated calculation of the most common refurbishment measures allows a comparison of up to 64 combinations of measures, the illustration of energy and CO2 savings, and an economic evaluation. The latter takes into account the time value of money, the uncertainty of future energy prices, and the possibility of delaying an investment. To this end, a net present value analysis and a real options analysis are implemented, enabling a comparison of retrofit alternatives with different initial and future cash flows both for buildings occupied by the investor (owner-occupier perspective) and for rented buildings (tenant perspective). Energy price scenarios as well as a Monte Carlo simulation account for the uncertainty in energy price trends. For a university building used as a test case, the simplified and time-saving data input methods were successfully tested and an automated evaluation of 64 typical retrofit combinations carried out. The results of the energy, ecological and economic efficiency evaluation shows that a generally preferred retrofit option cannot always be identified. Specifically, for the test case, the best-rated economic refurbishment possibility leads to the largest increase in final energy demand amongst all options considered, which points out the necessity of a multi-criteria evaluation.
1	Abstract   This paper investigates the energy analysis process of Building-Integrated Photovoltaics (BIPV) buildings using a case study and explores its accuracy. Building Information Modeling (BIM) software tools are used for modeling BIPV buildings and carrying out energy analysis. The case study simulates electricity production from four BIPV panel systems of the BIPV Experiment Demonstration House located in the Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI), Hsinchu, Taiwan, and compares the simulated results with three-year measured data. It is shown that a reasonably good estimate of the electricity production of a BIPV building at the building design stage was obtained in the case study.
1	Abstract   In this paper, we comparatively evaluate the performance of home energy management controller which is designed on the basis of heuristic algorithms; genetic algorithm (GA), binary particle swarm optimization (BPSO) and ant colony optimization (ACO). In this regard, we introduce a generic architecture for demand side management (DSM) which integrates residential area domain with smart area domain via wide area network. In addition, problem formulation is carried via multiple knapsack problem. For energy pricing, combined model of time of use tariff and inclined block rates is used. Simulation results show that all designed models for energy management act significantly to achieve our objections and proven as a cost-effective solution to increase sustainability of smart grid. GA based energy management controller performs more efficiently than BPSO based energy management controller and ACO based energy management controller in terms of electricity bill reduction, peak to average ratio minimization and user comfort level maximization.
1	Abstract   This study mainly explored human health and thermal comfort associated physiological response to temperature step-changes in winter. Several physiological parameters, including blood pressure, blood oxygen saturation (SPO 2 ), skin temperature and electrocardiograph (ECG), were measured to exam human reactions to temperature alterations of different intensities and directions. Three temperature step-change conditions (S10: 20 °C; 10 °C; 20 °C, S20: 20 °C; 0 °C; 20 °C, S40: 20 °C; −20 °C; 20 °C) were developed with 18 healthy subjects recruited. Statistical analysis shows that blood pressure is sensitive to temperature steps since significance is detected for values before and after step-changes in all three conditions. The increase in systolic pressure after sudden cooling in the large down-step (S40) reached 18 mm Hg, around fourfold and twice that in small (S10) and medium steps (S20), respectively. Besides, systolic pressure appears to be more responsive than diastolic pressure. Instant change in skin temperature caused by down-step is remarkably larger than that by up-steps. More than 45 min were demanded for skin temperature to become stable after 15 min’ exposure in −20 °C. In S20 and S40, the ration of LF (low frequency power) to HF (high frequency power) of ECG underwent remarkable decrease after sudden cooling, and vice versa.
0	Abstract   In the actual context of the greenhouse gases (GHGs) control, the industrial sector must find efficient and practical solutions to reduce their emissions. The feasibility of an aqueous mineral carbonation (MC) process was demonstrated at the laboratory scale under original mild conditions. In the continuity of this research, the process was tested at a pilot scale using a cement plant flue gas comprising of 12% to 20% CO 2 . Experiments were performed in an 18.7 L Parr reactor. Two different magnesium (Mg) rich tailings were used during the MC reactions with a solid/liquid ratio of 150 g/L, gas/liquid ratio of 3, room temperature (22 ± 3 °C) and a stirring speed of 600 rpm. The total pressure ranged between 2 and 10 atm. Each experiment comprised of six batches of gas with a residence time of 15 min to 30 min each for the liquid and 90 min for the solid. The results demonstrated that at low pressure (2 and 4 atm), between 90% and 96% of the CO 2  in the flue gas can be removed under dissolved form. The rate decreased to 64–74% at 10 atm. The cumulative quantity of dissolved CO 2  after six batches of treated gas increased with CO 2  partial pressure and from 0.08 to 0.25 g CO 2 /g of residue. The magnesium (Mg) leaching followed the same trend as the captured CO 2  quantity. The higher cumulative leaching rate for the magnesium was 19%. These results were lower than those expected compared to the laboratory scale. The results showed that 25% to 33% of the total dissolved CO 2  was captured as nesquehonite (MgCO 3 ·3H 2 O) of a high purity.
1	This paper presents a framework for performing dynamic analysis of coupled road vehicle and cable-stayed bridge systems under turbulent winds. Road vehicles are idealized as a combination of a number of rigid bodies connected by a series of springs and dampers. A cable-stayed bridge is modeled using the three-dimensional finite element method. The random roughness of the bridge deck is generated from a power spectral density function for the given road condition. Wind forces acting on the bridge, including buffeting forces and self-exciting forces, are simulated in the time domain using a fast spectral representation method, the aerodynamic admittance functions, the aerodynamic coefficients, and the flutter derivatives. The quasi-steady model is employed to generate crosswind forces on the road vehicles. The equations of motion of the coupled road vehicle-bridge system under turbulent winds are assembled using a fully computerized approach. The proposed framework is then applied to a real long span cable-stayed bridge with a group of moving high-sided road vehicles under turbulent winds. The results demonstrate that the proposed framework and the associated computer program can efficiently predict the dynamic response of coupled road vehicle and cable-stayed bridge systems subject to turbulent winds under a normal operation condition.
1	Abstract   A method for macro modelling timber-to-timber dowel type joints under shear loads using finite elements is presented. The proposed model, which includes a combination of nonlinear one-dimensional elements, is able to properly represent the hysteretic behaviour, stiffness degradation and failure of this type of joints. Experimental data from mechanical tests was used to define the macro model parameters. The proposed methodology does not require a high computational processing cost and, consequently, can be used for the nonlinear analysis of complex structural systems with a large number of connections.
1	Abstract   This paper reports the main results and conclusions of an International Benchmark jointly organized within the framework of a wide research program launched by the French Atomic Energy and Sustainable Energies Commission (CEA), Electricite De France (EDF) entitled “Seismic design and best-estimate Methods Assessment for Reinforced concrete buildings subjected to Torsion and nonlinear effect (SMART)”. This research program included first an experimental campaign on reduced scaled specimen and shaking table tests, and second, a Benchmark exercise based on the contest of numerical methods and methodologies referring to the experimental results from the tests. The objectives of the Benchmark exercise were to compare the results obtained by conventional seismic assessment methods with those obtained by best-estimate methods, to compare the methodologies of taking into account uncertainties in the numerical analyses when a probabilistic assessment should be performed and to create an event allowing the international community in earthquake engineering to discuss the aforementioned topics of common interest. According to the analysis of the results, it turned out that (a) conventional methods are clearly able to provide relevant seismic assessment at the design level; (b) when dealing with overdesign seismic loadings, advanced best-estimate methods seem to be able to capture several key indicators such as the frequency shift of the peak of the response spectra; and (c) the blind nonlinear computations demonstrate a high robustness level of the specimen based on both structural and local damage indicators (frequency shift and inter-story drift, respectively).
1	Accurate simulations of waves in oceanic and coastal areas should take dispersive effects over a large range of frequencies into account in the relevant order of nonlinearity of the equation. Taking the exact Hamiltonian–Boussinesq formulation of surface waves as starting point, a fully Hamiltonian consistent spatial–spectral approximation of the kinetic energy leads to a model that has exact dispersion above constant depth and can deal with arbitrary depth, for nonlinearity in second, third and fourth order of the surface elevation (Kurnia and van Groesen, 2014). In this paper we describe and show with simulations of various 1D cases of breaking and non-breaking waves how localized effects of partially or fully reflective walls, run-up on a coast and the dam-break problem can be dealt with in the implementation with global Fourier integral operators; a dynamic or post-processing step will show the interior flow properties.
1	Abstract   Accurate water levels modeling and prediction is essential for safety of coastal navigation and other maritime applications. Water levels modeling and prediction is traditionally developed using the least-squares-based harmonic analysis method that estimates the harmonic constituents from the measured water levels. If long water level measurements are not obtained from the tide gauge, accurate water levels prediction cannot be estimated. To overcome the above limitations, the current state-of-the-art artificial neural network has recently been developed for water levels prediction from short water level measurements. However, a highly nonlinear and efficient wavelet network model is proposed and developed in this paper for water levels modeling and prediction using short water level measurements. Water level measurements (about one month and a week) from six different tide gauges are employed to develop the proposed model and investigate the atmospheric changes effect. It is shown that the majority of error values, the differences between water level measurements and the modeled and predicted values, fall within the −5 cm and +5 cm range and root-mean-squared (RMS) errors fall within 1–6 cm range. A comparison between the developed highly nonlinear wavelet network model and the harmonic analysis method and the artificial neural networks shows that the RMS of the developed wavelet network model when compared with the RMS of the harmonic analysis method is reduced by about 70% and when compared with the RMS of the artificial neural networks is reduced by about 22%. It is also worth noting that if the atmospheric changes effect (meteorological effect) of the air pressure, the air temperature, the relative humidity, wind speed and wind direction are considered, the performance accuracy of the developed wavelet network model is improved by about 20% (based on the estimated RMS values).
1	Abstract   The microscopic morphology of self-doping highly sulfonated polyaniline in water has been investigated by a variety of techniques. The results of transmission electron microscope (TEM), atomic force microscope (AFM), dynamic light scattering (DLS) and viscometry are consistent with the nanometer colloid rather than the real solution. The colloidal particle size varies from 50 nm to 300 nm, depending on the dispersion environment, and the particle is a loose structure composed by spherical particulate with approximately 10–20 nm diameter, which is likely to be composed of a single chain of SPAn. In the low concentration zone, the linear dependence of specific viscosity to concentration has a positive slope and it can be attributed to the colloid dispersion rather than dilute polyelectrolyte solution.
1	Abstract   We have successfully synthesized and characterized newly synthesized oxygen-heterocyclic and π-conjugated dimers, 9,9′-bi(benzo[b]naphtha[2,1-d]furan) (9-BBR), as a potential semiconductor material with good environmental stability for organic field-effect transistor (OFET) devices. As expected from DFT calculations, spectroscopic analyses allow us to confirm the compound has lower highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level and larger HOMO–lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) gap than those of pentacene. Absorption spectra of 9-BBR in an air-saturated solution remain unchanged, indicating substantial environmental stability; in fact, the mobility values of 9-BBR-based OFET devices are stable even in the presence of air. Maximum field-effect mobilities up to 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 are obtained by 9-BBR-based OFETs with hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS)-treated substrates at Tsub = 100 °C. X-ray diffraction and atomic force microscopy allow us to conclude that better characteristics of 9-BBR-based OFETs prepared at high Tsub are attributed to good crystallinity and large-sized grain morphology in the thin films.
0	Abstract   A series of tungstate MWO 4  (M = Co, Zn and Ni) has been prepared by the polymeric precursor method. Meanwhile, yttria stabilized-zirconia (YSZ) based sensors using these oxides as sensing electrodes were investigated, and among the oxides tested, CoWO 4  was found to be the most suitable for the sensing electrode (SE) of the ammonia sensor. The sensor attached with CoWO 4  shows the fast response and recovery characteristics (not more than 5 s respectively) and large sensitivity (− 51 mV/decade) at elevated temperature. The electric potential difference (∆V) of the sensor varies almost linearly with the NH 3  concentrations in the examined range of 50–1000 ppm. The SEM observation reveals that the special microstructure of CoWO 4 -SE, bulky rod-like crystals coated by tiny particles, plays a significant role in sensing performance.
0	Adsorption and kinetic studies of lac dyeing of silk were investigated using, as optimal conditions, a pH of 3.0, a material to liquor ratio (MLR) of 1:100, an initial dye concentration of 450 mg/L and 60 min contact time. The progress of dye adsorption was monitored at lmax 487 nm by visible spectroscopy. The experimental data fitted well to the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms with a high correlation coefficient (R 2 ). The pseudo second-order kinetic model was indicated with the activation energy of 47.5 kJ/mol. It is suggested that the overall rate of lac dye adsorption is likely to be controlled by the chemical process. The values of the enthalpy (DH # ) and entropy of activation (DS # ) were 44.7 kJ/mol and � 175.7 J/mol K, respectively. The free energy of activation (DG # )a t 30 � C was 97.9 kJ/mol. The activation parameters with and without erythrolaccin in the lac dye were similar, consistent with erythrolaccin only having a slight effect on the lac dyeing of silk. The free energy (DG � ), enthalpy (DH � ) and entropy (DS � ) terms for
0	Abstract   The effect of molecular structure on the photophysical, electronic structure properties of a series of 9 conjugated diphenylanthrazolines were explored by UV–vis adsorption, photoluminescence spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry and quantum chemical calculations. The featureless adsorption bands observed ( λ  Abs  max : 382–420 nm) revealed low optical band gaps (2.05–2.25 eV) and the photoluminescence emission spectra ( λ  Em  max : 480–546 nm) and large Stokes shift (78–148 nm) suggested the presence of excimers in the solid state. With only one exception, the diphenylanthrazolines displayed reversible electrochemical reduction with potentials of −1.03 to −1.40 V, low ionization potentials (∼5.91–6.29 eV), relative to that of a saturated calomel electrode and high electron affinity (∼3.44–3.59 eV). Quantum chemical calculations using DFT B3LYP/6-31G showed nearly identical LUMO (−2.2 ∼ −2.3 eV) and HOMO (−5.2 ∼ −5.6 eV) values, revealing that both the electronic properties and the geometries of the diphenylanthrazolines depended on the anthrazoline backbone.
1	Within the framework of the realisation of the directive on Integrated pollution prevention and control (IPPC-Directive 96/61/EG), the techniques and the possible abatement options for numerous industrial sectors have to be characterised on a process level with regard to environmental benefits, technical practicability and especially economic feasibility. Annex I lists a series of industrial activities that are concerned by the IPPC-Directive, especially “installations for the surface treatment of substances, objects or products using organic solvents, in particular for dressing, printing, coating, degreasing, waterproofing, sizing, painting, cleaning or impregnating” (Annex I, No. 6.7). This paper gives an overview about the determination of candidate techniques for best available techniques (BAT) for the sectors adhesive and paint application in Germany.
1	Abstract   Water soluble polysaccharide from  Gracilaria birdiae  cultivated along the northeast coast of Brazil was characterized by infrared (FT-IR) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The composition of the polysaccharide in wt% was determined as: β- d -gal p  (50.3%), 3,6-anhydro-α- l -gal p  (40.5%) and -α- l -gal p -6 sulfate (9.2%). The ratio of  l / d  units (β- d -gal p  units and 3,6-anhydro-α- l -gal p  + α- l -gal p -6 sulfate) is that of an ideal agarose. The sulfate content calculated by S% accounts for 6.4%. 1D and 2D NMR techniques were employed in order to assign the spin system of polysaccharide without partial degradation. The structure is composed of → 4-3,6-anhydro-α- l -gal p  (1 → 3)β- d -gal p  1 → segments, with the possibility of a α- l -gal p  unit substituted at the 6-position by sulfate ester.
0	Abstract   Chitosan-stabilized nanoscale zero-valent iron (CS–nZVI) was prepared and used for the removal of acid fuchsine (AF) from aqueous solution with the assistance of ultrasound. More than 98.9% of AF was removed using CS–nZVI, aged CS–nZVI (exposed to air for 2 months), while only 14.6% removal efficiency was achieved after 15 min by chitosan alone with the assistance of ultrasound. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) confirmed that chitosan polymers were arranged in a homocentric layered structure. Thus, the polymer can prevent the aggregation of nZVI and increase their anti-oxidation capacity. X-ray diffraction (XRD) also suggested that the chitosan used in synthesis may protect nZVI nanoparticles from air oxidation. Different factors impacting on the removal of AF using CS–nZVI showed that the reduction increased when dosage and temperature increased, but decreased when pH and initial concentration rose. Kinetic studies revealed that the removal of AF fitted well to the pseudo-first-order model. The apparent activation energy was 55.34 kJ/mol, indicating a chemically controlled reaction. Finally, the application of CS–nZVI in dyeing wastewater led to a removal efficiency of 99% of AF, while the reuse test confirmed that AF's removal efficiency declined from 99.6 to 39.3% after seven cycles.
1	In this work, cellulose acetate was synthesized under homogeneous conditions. Cellulose was first dispersed in acetone, acetonitrile, 1,5-diazabicyclo(4.3.0)non-5-ene (DBN) or dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) and the resulting suspension was dissolved in an ionic liquid, 1,5-diazabicyclo(4.3.0)non-5-enium acetate [HDBN][OAc] at 70 °C for 0.5 h. It was possible to dissolve more than 12 wt% cellulose with a degree of polymerization in the range of 1000–1100. The dissolved cellulose was derivatized with acetic anhydride (Ac2O) to yield acetylated cellulose. As expected, the use of the co-solvents improved the acetylation process significantly. In fact, cellulose acetates with different properties could be obtained in half an hour, thus facilitating rapid processing. When DBN was used as the dispersing agent (the precursor of the ionic liquid), the problems associated with recycling of the ionic liquid were significantly reduced. In fact, additional [HDBN][OAc] was obtained from the interaction of the DBN and the by-product, acetic acid (from Ac2O). However, the cellulose acetate obtained in this manner had the lowest DS. Consequently, the native cellulose and acetylated celluloses were characterized by means of 1H- and 13C-NMR, FT-IR, GPC/SEC and by titration. The cellulose acetates produced were soluble in organic solvents such as acetone, chloroform, dichloromethane and DMSO which is essential for their further processing. It was demonstrated that the ionic liquid can be recovered from the system by distillation and re-used in consecutive acetylation batches.
1	Streptomyces phage integrase phiC31 is capable of mediating site-specific insertions in mammalian genomes. To avoid potential toxicity of long-term expression of phiC31 in host cells, we developed a method employing a cell-permeable TAT-phiC31 integrase. His6-tagged phiC31 proteins with or without an HIV TAT intercellular transducing peptide were generated and purified. Both of them retained integrase activity in vitro. However, TAT-phiC31 but not phiC31 was able to mediate a specific integration between two att sites in the genome of 293-PB [EGFP] report cell line. Transduced TAT-phiC31 was mainly localized in the cytoplasm that is similar to the localization of phiC31 when expressed through cDNA transfection. Adding a nuclear localization signal (NLS) peptide to the C-terminus of TAT-phiC31 facilitated nuclear localization of the integrase with an increased efficiency of recombination in the reporter cell line. These results demonstrated that TAT can mediate a cell membrane entry of phiC31 protein to perform a site-specific integration in mammalian cells. This is a simple and possibly safer method of site-specific recombination for gene delivery.
1	Abstract   Following the clinical success of Bevacizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptors, the search for new neutralizing antibodies targeting this molecule has continued until now. We used a human VEGF variant containing three mutations in the region recognized by Bevacizumab to direct antibody selection towards recognition of other epitopes. A total of seven phage-displayed antibody fragments with diverse binding properties in terms of inter-species cross-reactivity and sensitivity to chemical modifications of the antigen were obtained from a human phage display library. All of them were able to recognize not only the selector mutated antigen, but also native VEGF. One of these phage-displayed antibody fragments, denominated 2H1, was shown to compete with the VEGF receptor 2 for VEGF binding. Purified soluble 2H1 inhibited in a dose dependent manner the ligand–receptor interaction and abolished VEGF-dependent proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Our epitope disturbing strategy based on a triple mutant target antigen was successful to focus selection on epitopes different from a known one. Similar approaches could be used to direct phage isolation towards the desired specificity in other antigenic systems.
1	Camalexin is a tryptophan-derived phytoalexin that is induced in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana upon pathogen attack. Only few genes in the biosynthetic pathway of camalexin remain unidentified, however, investigation of candidate genes for these steps has proven particularly difficult partly because of redundancy in the genome of Arabidopsis. Here we describe metabolic engineering of the camalexin biosynthetic pathway in the transient Nicotiana benthamiana expression system. Camalexin accumulated in levels corresponding to what is seen in induced Arabidopsis thaliana. We have used this system to evaluate candidate genes suggested to be involved in the camalexin pathway. This has provided biochemical evidence for CYP71A12 conducting same reaction as CYP71A13 in the pathway. We discuss the prospects of using metabolic engineering of camalexin, both with respect to engineering plant defense and as a tool for screening yet unidentified candidate genes in the camalexin pathway.
1	Abstract   Prototype of structured microreactor plates with 300 μm deep flow channels was developed. Two plates with different structural elements, square and triangular, were used in the study. Flow behavior was investigated and the results showed excellent mixing behavior of gas and liquid phases. Hydrodynamic parameters and volumetric gas–liquid mass transfer coefficients were determined at various flow conditions. Gas holdup and the gas–liquid interfacial area were determined by an optical method using image processing software. Volumetric mass transfer coefficients were measured using nitrogen to strip oxygen from deionized water. The experimental results indicate a high mass transfer rate. Gas holdup and the total gas–liquid interfacial area were in the range of 20–45% and 2600–5600 m2 m−3, respectively. Volumetric mass transfer coefficients were as high as 1.1 s−1. An empirical correlation for the mass transfer coefficient was derived.
1	Abstract   We analyze the influence of surface heterogeneity, inducing a random    ζ   -potential at the walls in electroosmotic incompressible flows. Specifically, we focus on how surface heterogeneity modifies the physico-chemical processes (transport, chemical reaction, mixing) occurring in microchannel and microreactors. While the macroscopic short-time features associated with solute transport (e.g. chromatographic patterns) do not depend significantly on    ζ   -potential heterogeneity, spatial randomness in the surface    ζ   -potential modifies the spectral properties of the advection–diffusion operator, determining different long-term properties of transport/reaction phenomena compared to the homogeneous case. Examples of physical relevance (chromatography, infinitely fast reactions) are addressed.
1	Abstract   20 μm parylene C layer was deposited on silicone film to enhance the oxygen and water barrier properties, deposited at typical rate of 2.0 and 5.6 μm/h by controlling different deposited pressures. Surface morphology and roughness were observed by atomic force microscopy (AFM), surface morphology images show lower deposited rate that can lead to better quality film. 20 μm parylene C layer was deposited on silicone encapsulation of high power light emitting diodes (LEDs), the samples were tested by power temperature cycling (PTC) test from −40 to 85 °C, 15 min each extreme, and no corrosion, discoloration, cracks was found on the LEDs after the 1000 h PTC reliability test, and PTC test is intended to simulate worst case conditions encountered in typical applications, and parylene C floating membrane structure can stand such high stress and strain. Optical test on white and red LED samples with and without 20 μm parylene C layer, measurement result shows the optical transmittance more than 95%. 1000 h temperature humidity bias life test (T&amp;HB) is performed for the purpose of evaluating the reliability of LEDs in humid environments, energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis revealed much lower content of C (carbon) and O (oxygen) on the lead frame of LED with parylene C coating after T&amp;HB test on, and no oxidation was found in the LED package.
0	Abstract   We have prepared a series of ZnO films with various concentrations of Fe dopant by using facing-target magnetron sputtering system and investigated their structure, morphology, optical properties and magnetic properties by means of the X-ray diffraction, Raman spectrometer, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscope, UV–vis spectrophotometer, spectrofluorophotometer and vibrated sample magnetometer, respectively. The results showed Fe was in 2+ valence state in film. With increasing the concentration of Fe dopant the crystal quality deteriorated gradually and an increasing compressive stress occurred in ZnO films. All the grains grew with a columnar form along the [0 0 2] direction and the average size of grains decreased monotonically as the concentration of Fe dopant increased. The calculated results indicated that the band gap of films decreased with the increment of the concentration of Fe dopant, which resulted in the red-shift of violet emission peak. Moreover, the intensity of violet emission peak increased with the increment of Fe concentration because of the interface trap existing in depletion regions located at the ZnO grains boundaries. When the concentration of Fe dopant was smaller than 0.028, the films exhibited paramagnetic properties while the films displayed weak ferromagnetic properties when the concentration of Fe dopant increased to 0.041.
1	Abstract   A high-performance PdRu bimetallic catalyst supported on mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSN), PdRu/MSN, was prepared by a facile impregnation–hydrogen reduction method. It was found that PdRu/MSN showed 5 times higher activity than that of Pd/MSN towards the liquid-phase hydrogenation of phenol. The catalysts were characterized comprehensively by multiple techniques, X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and hydrogen temperature program reduction (TPR). It was revealed that adding Ru could effectively improve the Pd dispersion and promote the electronic interaction between the Pd and Ru, both of which contribute to enhancing the catalytic activity.
0	Abstract   In this paper, we describe a simple and novel approach for preparing tunable carbon-modified mesoporous TiO2 photocatalysts by combining the in-situ carbonization of PAA-Ti/TiO2, hydrothermal reaction process and post-calcination treatment. The synthesized carbon-modified mesoporous TiO2 powders were of high crystallinity, large specific surface area and good visible light response. The carbon species were formed by the carbonization of polyacrylate (PAA). The presence of carbonates was subsequently confirmed by the XPS spectra, which significantly narrow down the band gap of TiO2. The organic group in polyacrylate served as the carbon source and carbon resulted from in-situ carbonization treatment could help to inhibit the excessive growth of TiO2 grain and enlarge the pore structure of TiO2. The amount of carbon species could be feasibly modulated by adjusting the post-calcination temperature and the surface area of the photocatalyst was enlarged further after the partial removal of carbon species. The carbon-modified mesoporous TiO2 powders exhibit excellent reproducibility and photocatalytic performance under visible light irradiation.
0	Abstract   ZnO:Sn thin films were deposited onto thermally oxidized silicon substrates using a remote plasma reactive sputtering. Their optical constants (refractive index n and extinction coefficient k) were determined from ellipsometric data recorded over a wide spectral range (0.05–6 eV). Parametrization of ZnO:Sn complex dielectric permittivity consists of a parameterized semiconductor oscillator function describing the short wavelength absorption edge, a Drude oscillator describing free carrier absorption in near-infrared part of spectra and a Lorentz oscillator describing the long wavelength absorption edge and intra-band absorption in the ultra-violet part of the spectra. Using a Mott-Davis model, the increase in local disorder with increasing Sn doping is quantified from the short wavelength absorption edge onset. Using the Wemple-DiDomenico single oscillator model for the transparent part of the optical constants spectra, an increase in the centroid distance of the valence and conduction bands with increasing Sn doping is shown and only slight increase in intensity of the inter-band optical transition due to Sn doping occurs. The Drude model applied in the near-infrared part of the spectra revealed the free carrier concentration and mobility of ZnO:Sn. Results show that the range of transparency of prepared ZnO:Sn layers is not dramatically affected by Sn doping whereas electrical conductivity could be controlled by Sn doping. Refractive index in the transparent part is comparable with amorphous Indium Gallium Zinc Oxide allowing utilization of prepared ZnO:Sn layers as an indium-free alternative.
0	Abstract   SnS 1-x Se x  nanostructures with different Se-dopant concentrations were deposited on fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate through cathodic electrodeposition technique. The pH, temperature, applied potential ( E ), and deposition time remained were 2.1, 60 °C, −1 V, and 30 min, respectively. SnS 1-x Se x  nanostructures were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microcopy (FESEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), room temperature photoluminescence (PL), and UV–vis spectroscopy. The XRD patterns revealed that the SnS 1-x Se x  nanostructures were polycrystalline with orthorhombic structure. FESEM showed various kinds of morphologies in SnS 1-x Se x  nanostructures due to Se-doping. PL and UV–vis spectroscopy were used to evaluate the optical properties of SnS 1-x Se x  thin films. The PL spectra of SnS 1-x Se x  nanostructures displayed four emission peaks, those are a blue, a green, an orange, and a red emission. UV–vis spectra showed that the optical band gap energy ( E  g ) of SnS 1-x Se x  nanostructures varied between 1.22–1.65 eV, due to Se-doping.
0	Abstract   This study focuses on the evaluation of the potential use of the clay-rich raw materials in Denizli region to manufacture traditional ceramic products with industrial processing and determination of the provenance of archaeological ceramics. For this context, physical, chemical (X-ray fluorescence, XRF), mineralogical (X-ray diffraction, XRD), and thermal analysis (Differential Thermal Analyser-Thermogravimetry, DTA-TG) were performed and plasticity indexes (PI) were determined on the five representative clay-rich materials from three different locations (Yenicekent, Baskarci and Pamukkale) in Denizli region. Samples have been prepared by pressing and firing in the range of 700–1200 °C, then bulk density (BD), water absorption (WA), and unconfined compression strength (UCS) values of the samples were determined. Highly plastic clays were mainly composed of illite, smectite, kaolinite and mixed-layered clay minerals. Quartz, calcite, dolomite and hematite were also detected as non-clay minerals. Chemical composition of the clay samples without carbonate minerals indicated that the main oxide compositions were SiO 2 , Fe 2 O 3  and Al 2 O 3  whereas other oxides were present only in small quantities. Fired clays exhibited no major differences in BD and WA (except TR1). UCS values of all samples increased with rising firing temperatures. All technological properties showed significant densification at temperatures above 1000 °C. One of the studied clay-rich materials (TR3) has comparable characteristics for the production of structural ceramics as references sample (KRC). Furthermore, this sample could be a potential raw material source for the archeological ceramics in the region. In order to use TR2 sample it is necessary to add more plastic clays to enhance its workability, but other clays are not appropriate for such products.
1	Abstract   Near infrared (NIR) light allows deep tissue penetration and high spatial resolution due to the reduced scattering of long-wavelength photons. NIR light-activatable polymer nanoparticles are widely exploited for enhanced cancer imaging (diagnosis) and therapy owing to their superior photostability, photothermal conversion efficiency (or high emission rate), and minimal toxicity to cells and tissues. This review surveys the most recent advances in the synthesis of different NIR-absorbing and emissive polymer nanoformulations, and their applications for cancer imaging, photothermal therapy, theranostics and combination therapy by delivering multiple small molecule chemotherapeutics. Photo-responsive drug delivery systems for NIR light-triggered drug release are also discussed with particular emphasis on their molecular designs and formulations as well as photo-reaction mechanisms. Finally, outlook and challenges are presented regarding potential clinical applications of NIR light-activatable nanoformulations.
1	Abstract   Catalytic combustion has demonstrated potential for attaining the firing temperatures of current and next generation gas turbines with nitrogen oxides (NOx) production less than 3 parts-per-million by volume (ppmv), using natural gas fuel. The technology necessary to achieve this extremely low emissions performance with typical heavy-duty industrial and utility gas turbine operating cycle conditions, has been under development as a joint effort by the General Electric Company (GE) and Catalytica Combustion Systems Incorporated (CCSI) for several years with the support of Tokyo Electric Power Company Inc. (TEPCO). The most recent phase of this program, which began in late 1997, is focused on the durability of catalytic reactors in the gas turbine combustor operating environment. This paper presents the results of subscale catalytic reactor endurance testing at simulated steady-state and cyclic operating conditions typical of utility gas turbine service. The results of full-scale, full-pressure, laboratory testing of a catalytic combustion system having the most advanced catalytic reactor mechanical design features developed by CCSI are also presented.
0	Abstract   The activity of nickel molybdenum phosphide catalysts was studied for the hydrodesulfurization of dibenzothiophene at 573 K and total pressure of 2.0 MPa. The Al2O3-supported NiMo phosphide catalysts were prepared by successive and simultaneous methods. The effect of the reduction temperature on the catalyst activity was also studied. The simultaneous preparation was determined to be the best method for the preparation of the active supported catalyst for dibenzothiophene HDS. The 623 K-reduced catalyst had the highest HDS rate of the catalysts. Nickel migrated from the inside to the surface during the reaction and promoted the HDS activity. The active species in the dibenzothiophene HDS and the oxidation states of Mo, Ni and P in the catalyst before and after reaction and of S after the reaction were studied on the basis of an XPS analysis.
1	Abstract   Microbial Enhanced Oil Recovery (MEOR) is a process where microorganisms are used for tertiary oil recovery. Numerous mechanisms have been proposed in the literature through which microorganisms facilitate the mobilization of residual oil. Herein, we focus on the MEOR mechanisms of interfacial tension reduction (via biosurfactant) and bioclogging in water-wet micromodels, using  Shewanella oneidensis  (MR-1) that causes bioclogging and  Bacillus mojavensis  (JF-2) that produces biosurfactant and causes bioclogging. Micromodels were flooded with an assortment of flooding solutions ranging from metabolically active bacteria to nutrient limited bacteria to dead inactive biomass to assess the effectiveness of the proposed MEOR mechanisms of bioclogging and biosurfactant production. Results indicate tertiary flooding of the micromodel system with biomass and biosurfactant was optimal for oil recovery due to the combined effects of bioclogging of the pore-space and interfacial tension reduction. However, biosurfactant was able to recover oil in some cases dependent on wettability. Biomass without biosurfactant that clogged the pore-space also successfully produced additional oil recovery. When analyzing residual oil blob morphology, MEOR resulted in oil blob size and radius of curvature distributions similar to those obtained by an abiotic capillary desaturation test, where flooding rate was increased post secondary recovery. Furthermore, for the capillary number calculated during MEOR flooding with bioclogging and biosurfactant, lower residual oil saturation was measured than for the corresponding capillary number under abiotic conditions. These results suggest that bioclogging and biosurfactant MEOR is a potentially effective approach for pore morphology modification and thus flow alteration in porous media that can have a significant effect on oil recovery beyond that predicted by capillary number.
1	Abstract   Fluidized bed combustion as a flexible facility has been applied to burn liquid fuel. In the present work, a heavy oil (mazut) has been successfully dispersed and efficiently burnt with in situ desulfurization in a fluidized bed combustor. An atmospheric bubbling fluidized bed combustor of 300-mm inner diameter has been used. The liquid fuel has been injected into the bed using a multi-nozzle pneumatic injector. Measurements have been carried out under steady state operation. Results of experiments indicated that the in-bed combustion of fuel has been enhanced with increasing bed temperature, bed height, excess air and mass flow rate of dispersing air. Fortunately, the later trends improved both combustion efficiency and sulfur retention. High combustion efficiency has been obtained up to 99.7%. Sulfur retention up to 90% has been achieved by adding limestone particles. On the other hand, NO  x   has been slightly promoted with increasing the mentioned operating parameters, however, the obtained NO  x   emission was usually

The necessity of vacuum pump and the criterion of mesh size selection are also described. Through an application of measuring temperature in saturator, it shows that the system can evaluate the separation of gas–liquid two-phase flow and measure the liquid droplet temperature and the gas temperature effectively in counter-current spraying field.
1	Abstract   This paper presents the results of an experimental study of flow structure in horizontal equilateral triangular ducts having double rows of half delta-wing type vortex generators mounted on the duct’s slant surfaces. The test ducts have the same axial length and hydraulic diameter of 4 m and 58.3 mm, respectively. Each duct consists of double rows of half delta wing pairs arranged either in common flow-up or common flow-down configurations. Flow field measurements were performed using a Particle Image Velocimetry Technique for hydraulic diameter based Reynolds numbers in the range of 1000–8000. The secondary flow field differences generated by two different vortex generator configurations were examined in detail. The secondary flow is found stronger behind the second vortex generator pair than behind the first pair but becomes weaker far from the second pair in the case of Duct1. However, the strength of the secondary flow is found nearly the same behind the first and the second vortex generator pair as well as far from the second vortex generator pair in the case of Duct2. Both ducts are able to create a counter-rotating and a second set of twin foci. Duct2 is able to create the second set of twin foci in an earlier streamwise location than Duct1, as these foci are well-known to their heat transfer augmentation. A larger vortex formation area and a greater induced vorticity field between vortex pairs are observed for Duct2 compared with Duct1. As the induced flow field between the vortex pairs increases the heat transfer, and as the flow field between the vortex cores is found larger in the case of Duct2, therefore, it is expected to obtain better heat transfer characteristics for Duct2 compared with Duct1.
1	Abstarct   In general, internal cells are required to solve the deformation of a thin plate with an arbitrary distributed load using a conventional boundary element method (BEM). However, in this case, the merit of the BEM, which is the easy preparation of data, is lost. In this paper, it is shown that the deformation analysis of a thin plate with an arbitrary distributed load can be performed without the use of internal cells using the triple-reciprocity BEM. The distribution of an arbitrary load is interpolated using boundary integral equations. The problem of the thin plate, in accordance with Kirchhoff's theory, is formulated by means of two coupled Poisson equations, which are expressed in integral form using the second theorem of Green in the classical way. A new computer program was developed and applied to several problems.
1	Abstract   Aiming to obtain metal-organic frameworks with high dimensionality, two new 1D coordination polymers with the general formula {[Co(DHT)(DMF) 2 (H 2 O) 2 ] n }  (1)  and {[Cu(GLU)(DMF)] n }  (2)  have been obtained, where DHT = 2,5-dihydroxyterephthalate; GLU = Glutarate; and DMF = Dimethylformamide. Both coordination compounds involve simple chain formations in which the carboxylate groups from ligands adopt monodentate (for  1 ) and bidentate (for  2 ) coordination modes to the metal center. In this work, both polymers synthesized contain solvent molecules coordinated to metal centers, which represent potential open metal sites to allow postsynthetic modifications that may increase the dimensionality of the systems. The dinuclear group formation of type tetrakis (acetate) dicopper complexes, in the case of polymer  (2) , is worth mentioning. This unit may be categorized as a secondary building unit (SBU) like a paddlewheel formed in situ. Herein, Raman spectroscopy had an important role in its characterization. So, besides X-ray diffraction by single crystals, vibrational spectroscopy had been employed to reinforce the coordination modes analysis, especially through a good approximation of antisymmetric and symmetric shifts of vibrational modes from the carboxylate group of ligands (in comparison to the ionic form of the free ligand). Finally, we propose the removal of solvents coordinated to metal centers by activation for increasing the system dimensionality.
1	Abstract   Using acclimated sludge, the removal of a copper-phthalocyanine dye (Reactive Turquoise Blue KN-G, RTB) from wastewater was studied under anaerobic and aerobic conditions to assess the fate of the RTB in wastewater treatment facilities. An immediately sharp reduction of the RTB concentration in solution was observed after the influent was fed into the reactor, which reflects rapid biosorption. Aerobic microorganisms were capable of utilizing RTB as the sole carbon and energy source for proliferation while anaerobic microorganisms were not, however, sufficient glucose as ancillary carbon source was essential for both systems to maintain long-term, stable and efficient performance. Glucose promoted the growth of biomass and microbial activity. Sufficient glucose prevented aerobic microorganisms decreasing activity due to high-concentration RTB. The cooperation of biosorption and biodegradation were considered to be the mechanisms for RTB removal from wastewater.
1	Abstract   Tannase of  Enterobacter  sp. was purified and characterized at molecular level. It was found to be 90 kDa in molecular weight. The purified enzyme showed maximum activity at 40 °C. The enzyme was also found to be active in acidic range of pH. The nucleotide and amino acid sequence of tannase exhibited resemblance with the other reported tannase sequences of bacteria, fungi and plants. Probably, this is the first report of tannase gene in  Enterobacter  sp. The investigation suggests that the purified enzyme can be useful to synthesize molecules of pharmaceutical interest. In addition to above, the enzyme tannase and the organism itself can also be employed to protect grazing animals and environment against the toxic effects caused by tannins in them.
1	The influence of temperature, 50 and 60 °C, at hydraulic retention times (HRTs) of 20 and 10 days, on the performance of anaerobic digestion of cow manure has been investigated in completely stirred tank reactors (CSTRs). Furthermore, the effect of both daily downward and daily upward temperature fluctuations has been studied. In the daily downward temperature fluctuation regime the temperatures of each reactor was reduced by 10 °C for 10 h while in the daily upward fluctuation regime the temperature of each reactor was increased 10 °C for 5 h. The results show that the methane production rate at 60 °C is lower than that at 50 °C at all experimental conditions of imposed HRT except when downward temperature fluctuations were applied at an HRT of 10 days. It also was found that the free ammonia concentration not only affects the acetate-utilising bacteria but also the hydrolysis and acidification process. The upward temperature fluctuation affects the maximum specific methanogenesis activity more severely as compared to imposed downward temperature fluctuations. The results clearly reveal the possibility of using available solar energy at daytime to heat up the reactor(s) without the need of heat storage during nights, especially at an operational temperature of 50 °C and at a 20 days HRT, and without the jeopardising of the overheating.
1	Abstract   Long-term performance of methanol biocatalysis conversion in a lab-scale UASB reactor was evaluated. Properties of granules were traced to examine the impact of methanol on granulation. Methanolic wastewater could be stably treated during initial 240 d with the highest biogas production rate of 18.6 ± 5.7 L/L d at OLR 48 g-COD/L d. However, the reactor subsequently showed severe granule disintegration, inducing granule washout and process upsets. Some steps (e.g. increasing influent Ca 2+  concentration, etc.) were taken to prevent rising dispersion, but no clear improvement was observed. Further characterizations in granules revealed that several biotic/abiotic factors all caused the dispersion: (1) depletion of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) and imbalance of protein/polysaccharide ratio in EPS; (2) restricted formation of hard core and weak Ca-EPS bridge effect due to insufficient calcium supply; and (3) simplification of species with the methanol acclimation. More efforts are required to solve the technical deficiencies observed in methanolic wastewater treatment.
1	Abstract   In this study, nutrients were immobilized on the hydrochars obtained by hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) of a vinasse and sugarcane bagasse mixture, in the presence of acid, base and salt additives at temperatures of 150, 190 and 230 °C. The increase in temperature caused higher immobilization of Ca, Mg, K, N, Cu, Mn, Zn, B, P and Fe in all hydrochars produced. H 3 PO 4  and NaOH immobilized higher amounts of P, Mg and Mn, while Ca was immobilized in higher quantities in the presence of H 3 PO 4  and (NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 . The addition of H 2 SO 4 , H 3 PO 4  and (NH 4 ) 2 SO 4  was responsible for an increased immobilization of P, N, Ca, Mg and K. The immobilization of B, not present in the starting raw material, was possible with the addition of H 3 BO 3 . The results showed that it is possible to alter the reaction medium to immobilize nutrients on hydrochars produced from vinasse and sugarcane bagasse, for agricultural applications.
1	The metabolic function of microbial community dominated organics and nutrients transformation in aerobic composting process. In this study, the metabolic characteristics of bacterial and fungal communities were evaluated in 60 days composting of sludge and pumice by using FUNGuild and PICRUSt, respectively. The results showed that microbial community structure and metabolic characteristics were distinctively different at four composting periods. Bacterial genes related to carbohydrate metabolisms decreased during the first 30 days, but bacterial sequences associated with oxidative phosphorylation and fatty acids synthesis were enhanced in curing phase. Most of fungal animal pathogen and plant pathogen disappeared after treatment, and the abundance of saprotroph fungi increased from 44.3% to 97.8%. Oxidation reduction potential (ORP) significantly increased from -28 to 175 mV through incubation. RDA analysis showed that ORP was a crucial factor on the succession of both bacterial and fungal communities in sludge composting system.
0	Abstract   Cubic boron nitride (cBN) coatings were deposited on silicon nitride (Si3N4) cutting inserts through conductive boron-doped diamond (BDD) buffer layers in an electron cyclotron resonance microwave plasma chemical vapor deposition (ECR MPCVD) system. The adhesion and crystallinity of cBN coatings were systematically characterized, and the influence of doping level of BDD on the phase composition and microstructure of the cBN coatings were studied. The nano-indentation tests showed that the hardness and elastic modulus of the obtained cBN coatings were 78 GPa and 732 GPa, respectively. The tribological properties of the cBN coatings were evaluated by using a ball-on-disc tribometer with Si3N4 as the counterpart. The coefficient of the friction and the wear rate of the cBN coatings were estimated to be about 0.17 and 4.1 × 10− 7 mm3/N m, respectively, which are remarkably lower than those of titanium aluminum nitride (TiAlN) coatings widely used in machining ferrous metal. The results suggest that cBN/BDD coated Si3N4 inserts may have great potentials for advanced materials machining.
0	Abstract   The coking during propene oligomerisation over silica-supported heteropoly acid (HPA) H3PW12O40 (PW) and its palladium-doped form (1.6–2.5 wt.% Pd) and subsequent catalyst regeneration have been studied. Coke formation has been found to cause rapid deactivation of the catalysts. The coked versus fresh catalysts have been characterised by       31   P    and       13   C    MAS NMR, XRD, XPS and TGA/TPO to reveal that the Keggin structure of the catalysts was unaffected by coke deposition in both undoped and Pd-doped PW/SiO2. The Pd doping has been shown to affect the nature of coke formed, inhibiting the formation of polynuclear aromatics. Addition of water, methanol or acetic acid to the propene flow causes the formation of oxygenated products at the expense of propene oligomers. These additives have been found to inhibit the coking, water being the most effective inhibitor. The removal of coke from HPA catalysts has been attempted using solvent extraction, ozone treatment and aerobic oxidation. The extraction (e.g. with CH2Cl2) allows removing soft coke (with the TGA removal range of 170–370°C) but is unable to remove hard coke (with the TGA removal range of 370–570°C). Ozone treatment can remove both soft and hard coke at 150°C. The aerobic burning of coke on the undoped PW/SiO2 proceeds to completion in the temperature range centred at 500–560°C, exceeding the temperature of PW decomposition. Doping the catalyst with Pd significantly decreases this temperature to allow catalyst regeneration at temperatures as low as 350°C without loss of catalytic activity.
0	Abstract   TiO 2 –Ni inverse catalysts were prepared using an atomic layer deposition (ALD) process, and catalytic CO 2  reforming of methane (CRM) reactions over the catalysts (either bare Ni or TiO 2  coated-Ni particles) were performed using a continuous flow reactor at 800 °C. The TiO 2 –Ni inverse catalyst had a higher catalytic reactivity at the initial stage of the CRM reaction at 800 °C compared to that of bare Ni catalysts. Moreover, the high activity of the TiO 2 –Ni catalyst was maintained over 65 h of the CRM reaction at 800 °C, whereas deactivation of the bare Ni surface began within 1 h under the same conditions. Surface analysis using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and Raman spectroscopy showed that deposition of graphitic carbon was effectively suppressed in the presence of TiO 2  nanoparticles on the Ni surface, thereby improving the catalytic activity and stability of the TiO 2 –Ni catalytic system. We suggest that utilizing the decorative effect of oxide nanoparticles on the surface of metal catalyst has great potential for the development of metal-based catalysts with high stability and reactivity.
1	Abstract   The presence and morphology of microcalcification clusters are the main point to provide early indications of breast carcinomas. However, the visualization of those structures may be jeopardized due to overlapping tissues even for digital mammography systems. Although digital mammography is the current standard for breast cancer diagnosis, further improvements should be achieved in order to address some of those physical limitations. One possible solution for such issues is the application of the dual-energy technique (DE), which is able to highlight specific lesions or cancel out the tissue background. In this sense, this work aimed to evaluate several quantities of interest in radiation applications and compare those values with works present in the literature to validate a modified PENELOPE code for digital mammography applications. For instance, the scatter-to-primary ratio (SPR), the scatter fraction (SF) and the normalized mean glandular dose (DgN) were evaluated by simulations and the resulting values were compared to those found in earlier studies. Our results present a good correlation for the evaluated quantities, showing agreement equal or better than 5% for the scatter and dosimetric-related quantities when compared to the literature. Finally, a DE imaging chain was simulated and the visualization of microcalcifications was investigated.
1	Abstract   β-Carotene, positively recognized in literature  [18, followed by subsequent papers]  as regards its film-forming abilities at the water/air interface, was subjected to further Langmuir monolayer investigations. A wide variety of organic solvents and their mixtures have been tested in order to choose the best spreading solvents for monolayer experiments. A constant surface pressure rise, without characteristic for collapse spike or plateau, was observed upon compressing films dropped onto the air/water interface from all the solvents studied. However, a surface pressure increase alone is an insufficient criterion to evidence a true monolayer formation. The application of Brewster angle microscopy (BAM) indicated the presence of crystalline domains even at large molecular areas, contrary to homogeneous monolayer, which has been expected based on the above-mentioned reports. The addition of surface active substances (n-pentanol or  iso -propanol) into β-carotene solution does not improve whatsoever its spreading behaviour. Our experiments indicate that β-carotene is not capable of forming monomolecular films at the free water surface and therefore is not suitable material for investigations with the Langmuir technique. Thus, this study shows the importance of using complementary – to classical surface manometry – techniques to confirm the true monolayer formation from molecules of interest.
1	The structural integrity and protection of bacterial biofilms are intrinsically associated with a matrix of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) produced by the bacteria cells. However, the role of these substances during biofilm adhesion to a surface remains largely unclear. In this study, the influence of EPS on Xylella fastidiosa biofilm formation was investigated. This bacterium is associated with economically important plant diseases; it presents a slow growth rate and thus allows us to pinpoint more precisely the early stages of cell-surface adhesion. Scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy show evidence of EPS production in such early stages and around individual bacteria cells attached to the substrate surface even a few hours after inoculation. In addition, EPS formation was investigated via attenuated total reflectance (ATR) Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). To this end, X. fastidiosa cells were inoculated within an ATR liquid cell assembly. IR–ATR spectra clearly reveal EPS formation already during the early stages of X. fastidiosa biofilm formation, thereby providing supporting evidence for the hypothesis of the relevance of the EPS contribution to the adhesion process.
1	Abstract   The aim of this work is to demonstrate that the structural and fluidic properties of polymer foam tissue scaffolds, post-fabrication but prior to the introduction of cells, can be engineered via exposure to high power ultrasound. Our analysis is supported by measurements of fluid uptake during insonification and imaging of the scaffold microstructure via X-ray computed tomography, scanning electron microscopy and acoustic microscopy. The ultrasonic treatment is performed with a frequency of 30 kHz, average intensities up to 80,000 Wm − 2  and exposure times up to 20 h. The treatment is found to increase the mean pore size by over 10%. More striking is the improvement in fluid uptake: for scaffolds with only 40% water uptake via standard immersion techniques, we can routinely achieve full saturation of the scaffold over approximately one hour of exposure. These desirable modifications occur with negligible loss of scaffold integrity and mass, and are optimized when the ultrasound treatment is coupled to a pre-wetting stage with ethanol. Our findings suggest that high power ultrasound is highly targeted towards flow obstructions in the scaffold architecture, thereby providing an efficient means to promote pore interconnectivity and fluid transport in thick foam tissue scaffolds.
1	Abstract   In this paper, we facilitated the preparation of uniform calcium carbonate nanospheres and the encapsulation of anticancer drug (Doxorubicin, Dox) in one step by a facile bio-inspired mineralization method at room temperature. Hesperidin (Hesp), a natural originated flavanone glycoside, was introduced as crystallization modifier. The obtained Dox encapsulated CaCO3 nanospheres (Dox@CaCO3-Hesp NSs) having a narrow size range of ~ 200 nm. The drug loading/release studies reveal that these Dox@CaCO3-Hesp NSs have a drug loading efficiency (DLE) of 83% and drug loading content (DLC) of 14 wt%. Besides, the release of Dox from Dox@CaCO3-Hesp NSs was pH depended. At pH = 7.4, only a small amount (~ 28%) of Dox was released. While at pH = 5.0, all amount of incorporated Dox was released. Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) image reveals the Dox@CaCO3-Hesp NSs can internalize the cells. These results suggest the Dox@CaCO3-Hesp NSs can be potentially used to utilize pH-responsive delivery of anticancer drugs.
0	Abstract   Biodegradable magnesium (Mg)-based materials are a potential alternative to permanent implants for application in children. Nevertheless effects of those materials on growth plate cartilage and chondrogenesis have not been previously evaluated.  In vitro differentiation of ATDC5 cells was evaluated under the influence of pure Mg (PMg), Mg with 10 wt% of gadolinium (Mg-10Gd) and Mg with 2 wt% of silver (Mg-2Ag) degradation products (extracts) and direct cell culture on the materials.  Gene expression showed an inhibitory effect on ATDC5 mineralization with the three extracts and a chondrogenic potential of Mg-10Gd.  Cells cultured in Mg-10Gd and Mg-2Ag extracts showed the same proliferation and morphology than cells cultured in growth conditions. Mg-10Gd induced an increase in production of ECM and a bigger cell size, similar to the effects found with differentiation conditions.  An increased metabolic activity was observed in cells cultured under the influence of Mg-10Gd extracts, indicated by an acidic pH during most of the culture period.  After 7 days of culture on the materials, ATDC5 growth, distribution and ECM synthesis were higher on Mg-10Gd samples, followed by Mg-2Ag and PMg, which was influenced by the homogeneity and composition of the degradation layer.  This study confirmed the tolerance of ATDC5 cells to Mg-based materials and a chondrogenic effect of Mg-10Gd. Further studies in vitro and in vivo are necessary to evaluate cell reactions to those materials, as well as the effects on bone growth and the biocompatibility of the alloying system in the body.
1	As it is known that bacterial cellulose (BC) is a biocompatible and natural biopolymer due to which it has a large set of biomedical applications. But still it lacks some desired properties, which limits its uses in many other applications. Therefore, the properties of BC need to be boosted up to an acceptable level. Here in this study for the first time, a new natural nanocomposite was produced by the incorporating keratin (isolated from human hair) to the BC (produced by Acetobacter xylinum) to enhance dermal fibroblast cells' attachment. Two different approaches were used in BC based nanocomposite production: in situ and post modifications. BC/keratin nanocomposites were characterized using SEM, FTIR, EDX, XRD, DSC and XPS analyses. Both production methods have yielded successful results for production of BC based nanocomposite-containing keratin. In vitro cell culture experiments performed with human skin keratinocytes and human skin fibroblast cells indicate the potential of the novel BC/keratin nanocomposites for use in skin tissue engineering.
0	Abstract   Recently, the controlled drug delivery system has become a potential platform for biomedical application. Herein, we developed a pH and light-dual controlled cargo release system exhibiting AND logic based on MCM-41 mesoporous silica nanoparticles, which was surface modified using β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) with imine bond and azobenzene derivative. The complex of β-CD and azobenzene derivative effectively blocked the cargo delivery in pH = 7.0 phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution without 365 nm UV light irradiation. The cargo was fully released when both factors of acidic environment (pH = 5.0 PBS) and 365 nm UV light irradiation were satisfied, meanwhile only very little cargo was delivered if one factor was satisfied. The result also demonstrates that the opening/closing of the gate and the release of the cargo in small portions can be controlled.
1	Increasing energy efficiency and reducing water consumption are two of the key requirements in moving toward a more sustainable mining industry. This paper demonstrates a method of determining the lowest energy option for a mine/mill water system network. The method uses a linear programming algorithm to compare different possible combinations of supplying water to mine and mill consumers. First, a site water balance is determined and then every major water consumer and source is specified. Water sources may require pumping, cooling and/or treatment before the water meets the specifications of the water consumer. The amount of energy required for each water source to supply each consumer is calculated and then the model is solved to minimize power consumption. An example is used to illustrate the method.
1	Abstract   Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from food transportation include emissions from energy consumption and refrigerant leakage into the environment. The hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and perflourocarbons (PFCs) generated by refrigerant leakage markedly increase global warming (GW). The issue of emissions from temperature-controlled food delivery is important for carriers. This paper aims to estimate GHG emissions from the Traditional Multi-Vehicle Distribution (TMVD) and Multi-Temperature Joint Distribution (MTJD) systems by formulating mathematical models that consider delivery scheduling for time-dependent demand of multi-temperature foods. Furthermore, this paper analyzes and compares the emissions from each source in the two systems to explore the influence of delivery scheduling on emissions. The results indicate that, as compared to the TMVD system, the MTJD system yields less total emissions by lowering fuel consumption even when it generates more GHG due to refrigerant leakage and electric power consumption for freezers, which accounts for an extremely low percentage of total emissions. This paper suggests carriers should use the MTJD system to reduce routing distances and emissions simultaneously.
0	Abstract   The production of hydrogen from hydrogen sulphide has a twofold goal as it can be seen as a challenging opportunity for combining hydrogen recovery with the abatement of a highly toxic pollutant. Despite the thermodynamics encourage hydrogen sulphide splitting with respect to water splitting, no hydrogen sulphide dissociation process proving a net superiority with respect to others has been exploited at large scale yet. This paper aims at surveying the most important techniques being proposed for hydrogen sulphide splitting, with a particular attention to chemical methods that seem to be promising candidates for real industrial applications. Several processes based on thermal dissociation, catalytic cracking, multistep thermochemical methods and photocatalytic splitting are compared and critically analysed pointing out merits and drawbacks having a basic role in technology transfer. The main objective of this short review consists of collecting new process trends and improvements in pre-existing strategies in matter of hydrogen sulphide dissociation during the last two decades. Some new techniques here reported are inspired to recent issues in material science and nanotechnology bringing basic innovations for a non-conventional hydrogen production from such a waste.
1	Abstract   With increasing demand of abiotic resources also the pollution of natural resources like water and soil has risen in the last decades due to global industrial and technological development. Thus, enhancing resource efficiency is a key goal of national and international strategies. For a comprehensive assessment of all related impacts of resource extraction and use all three sustainability dimensions have to be taken into account: economic, environmental and social aspects. Furthermore, to avoid burden shifting life cycle based methods should be applied. As companies need operational tools and approaches, a comprehensive method has been developed to measure resource efficiency of products, processes and services in the context of sustainable development (ESSENZ). Overall 21 categories are established to measure impacts on the environment, physical and socio-economic availability of the used resources as well as their societal acceptance. For the categories socio-economic availability and societal acceptance new approaches are developed and characterization factors are provided for a portfolio of 36 metals and four fossil raw materials. The introduced approach has been tested on several case studies, demonstrating that it enhances the applicability of resource efficiency to assess product systems significantly by providing an overall framework that can be adopted across sectors, using indicators and methods which are applicable and can be integrated into existing life cycle assessment based schemes.
1	Abstract   As a first step in the monitoring of soil radon in search of harbingers of earthquakes, an investigation of suitable measurement techniques was conducted. As a result of these investigations, the following recommendations are made. Semiconductor and scintillation (ZnS) counters are the most suitable for Rn monitoring with chambers for natural drift of emanations to the detector. The method of compulsory selection of soil air is hardly effective. Soil aerosols might enter the drift chamber; these aerosols transfer many radioactive isotopes. The most suitable locations for placement of detectors of radon are cellars. Measurements should be continuous in character. The choice of a place for monitoring near mud volcanoes and faults should be determined by an Rn survey. In mud volcanoes, the best locations are areas with an average concentration of radon. For faults, identical tendencies of change in radon are maintained at some distance from the borders of the fault. For large faults, this distance is equal to half the width of the fault. For small faults, this distance increases by up to 3 times the fault width. All the recommendations were applied in the Northern Caucasus. Reliable results of the changes in soil radon were obtained during strong geophysical processes.
1	Abstract   The principle of the X-ray detector which can simultaneously perform the measurement of the exposure rate and 2D (two-dimensional) distribution is described. A commercially available CMOS image sensor has been adopted as the key part to receive X-ray without any scintillators. The correlation between the pixel value (PV) and the absorbed exposure rate of X-ray is studied using the improved Elman neural network. Comparing the optimal adjustment process of the BP (Back Propagation) neural network and the improved Elman neural network, the neural network parameters are selected based on the fitting curve and the error curve. The experiments using the practical production data show that the proposed method achieves high accurate predictions to 10 −15 , which is consistent with the anticipated value. It is proven that it is possible to detect the exposure rate using the X-ray detector with the improved Elman algorithm for its advantages of fast converges and smooth error curve.
1	This paper presents a fault tolerant control method to control the outdoor air ventilation and AHU supply air temperature, which concerned indoor air quality and humidity, respectively to satisfy ASHRAE Standard in VAV systems. The principal component analysis method, joint angle method, and compensatory reconstruction are used to detect, isolate, and reconstruct the fault, respectively for fault tolerant control. They are tested and evaluated in a simulation environment under the condition of temperature and flow sensors with fix bias faults.
1	Abstract   The study aims at investigating the heat dissipation capability of a board-level phased-array transmitter module in 65-nm CMOS technology with 4-element and 16-element antenna arrays for 60-GHz communication in a steady state under natural convection, and furthermore, performing thermal enhancement design. Both cavity-up and cavity-down flip chip packaging configurations are developed for the system-in-package module, and their thermal performance is examined and compared. To assess the thermal performance, both a three-dimensional (3D) heat conduction finite element model and a 3D computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model are implemented. The validity of the proposed numerical models is demonstrated by comparing the calculated results with each other, and also with the IR thermography measurement data based on JEDEC specifications. Besides, the uncertainty in the input supplied power from the specific power supply is examined, and its impact on the measured chip junction temperature is also assessed. Furthermore, enhancement of the thermal performance of the 16-elelemt transmitter module is sought through application of thermal modules and parametric CFD study. The crucial parameters most affecting the thermal performance of the module are identified, and further applied in the subsequent experimental design using a Taguchi method to pursue the optimal parametric setting for maximal thermal performance.
1	Abstract   The direct leakage of rotary air preheater was studied both experimentally and numerically. We have tested different seal structures from single to triple seals cases, which are used in real air preheater equipments to control the direct leakage. To describe the effect of the gap width and inlet pressure on the orifice coefficient and in terms of the air leakage engineering modifying factor, some improved relationships were obtained, which are superior over the traditional ones because of their better accuracy. The main factors that affect the air leakage are the air flow expansion, inlet velocity at the seal gap entrance, and the flow boundary conditions on the seal plate surface. The first upstream seal accounts for most of the total pressure drop on the entire multiple-seal system. The simulation results on the multiple-seal system show that the system of triple seals is better in controlling the leakage than that of the double seals when the seal gap is small; however, when the seal gap increases up to a critical value, the difference between the double- and triple-seal becomes negligible.
1	Abstract   Plate-fin heat exchangers (PFHEs) are mostly employed in small- and medium-sized LNG plants. However, studies on the heat transfer performance of mixed refrigerant in a PFHE under low-quality have rarely been conducted. In this paper, an experimental setup that utilized a single-stage cryogenic cycle with commercial compressors and a customized PFHE was established to study the heat transfer performance of the PFHE throughout the cool-down process. The components of the mixed refrigerant included nitrogen, methane, ethylene, propane and isobutane. Several experiments were conducted to obtain a refrigeration temperature as low as −160 °C. The characteristics of the cool-down process and the temperature difference change in the RHE were discussed. Meanwhile, five sets of condensation correlations and 13 sets of flow boiling correlations were selected to predict the HTC in the PFHE. The experimental overall HTC of the PFHE based on the hot sides was approximately between 11.88 and 37.74 W m−2 K−1. However, most of the existing correlations were not able to correctly predict the HTC of the PFHE in this work. Meanwhile, some suggestions regarding the PFHE design in a mixed refrigerant cryogenic system were proposed.
1	Abstract   The influence of the heating rate on the low temperature phase transition (PT) of the piezoelectric crystal potassium niobate (KNO) was studied by micro-Raman spectroscopy. It is found that crystallographic defects are more important than the heating rate for the onset of the PT. If the strain shifts the transition temperature (TT) from the rhombohedral to the orthorhombic phase to lower values, then it also shifts the reverse PT to higher temperatures. The PT on heating is more sensitive to the rate than the PT on cooling.
1	Abstract   An adaptive predictor–corrector reentry guidance algorithm with self-defined way-points is proposed. In the guidance process, the reentry trajectory is divided into the predictor–corrector phase and the trajectory onboard generation and tracking phase which is near to the endpoint position of reentry and utilized to improve the accuracy and adaptivity of the guidance. In the first phase, the predictor–corrector algorithm is applied to solve the guidance problem between the self-defined way-points. Moreover the position parameters of reentry trajectory are translated into the parameters related to the reentry plane by orthogonal transformation in the spherical coordinate to improve robustness of guidance algorithm. In addition, the predictor–corrector algorithm is implemented using a brain emotional learning based intelligence controller (BELBIC). In the second phase, the trajectory from the current point to the endpoint is generated onboard and the linear–quadratic regulator (LQR) theory is employed for trajectory tracking. The effectivity of the proposed guidance is validated by simulations in conditions of the nominal case, the environment dispersed case and the endpoint maneuvering case. The advantages of this guidance in coping with disturbances, reducing time of numerical trajectory prediction and being suitable for maneuver endpoint are analyzed with the simulation results.
1	Abstract   A diffusion-reaction kinetic model is presented for the kinetic analysis of the removal process of phenolic compounds using hydrogen peroxide and immobilized peroxidase. The good results obtained in the fitting of the experimental data to the model confirm its validity, in the experimental range considered, as well as the one of the extended version of the Dunford mechanism proposed in a previous paper.  The phenomenon of enzyme deactivation and/or sequestration by the precipitated olygomers/polymers, which has been widely described in the literature, is here modeled as the growth of a polymeric film over the external surface and inside the pores of the catalytic particles that contain the enzyme, thus determining the appearance of diffusional limitations and an increasing loss of activity. The deactivation phenomena, interpreted and modeled in terms of the effectiveness factor, are included in the kinetic model.  To confirm the validity of the model, several series of experiments were carried out in a discontinuous tank reactor. Some of these experimental series were used to obtain the values of the kinetic parameters by numerical calculation and using an error minimization algorithm. Since the model reproduces the behavior of the system for the series of experiments not used for the determination of the parameters, it can be affirmed that the model is suitable for the kinetic analysis of the system under study.
0	Abstract   Pristine, oxidized, ethylenediamine, diethylenetriamine and triethylenetetramine modified multi-walled carbon nanotubes (raw-MWCNT, o-MWCNT, e-MWCNT, d-MWCNT and t-MWCNT, respectively) were employed as adsorbents in order to study individual and competitive adsorption characteristics of Pb 2+  and Cd 2+  ions. In batch tests, the influence of functionalization, pH, contact time, initial metal ion concentration and temperature, on the ion adsorption on MWCNTs was studied. Adsorption of Pb 2+  and Cd 2+  on MWCNTs strongly depends on pH. Time dependent Pb 2+  adsorption and adsorption data can be described by pseudo-second-order kinetic model and by Langmuir isotherm, respectively. The maximum adsorption capacities of Pb 2+  and Cd 2+  on d-MWCNT were 58.26 and 31.45 mg g −1  at 45 °C, respectively. The competitive adsorption studies showed that the metal order affinity with respect to d-MWCNT and e-MWCNT is Pb 2+  &gt; Cd 2+ . Thermodynamic parameters showed that the adsorption of Pb 2+  on appropriate nanotubes was spontaneous and endothermic. According to desorption studies, regenerated MWCNT can be reused over five times with minimal loss of adsorption capacity. Comparison of obtained results with capacities and affinities of other adsorbents indicates suitability of amino-functionalized MWCNT application for removal of Pb 2+  and Cd 2+  from aqueous solution.
0	Abstract   In the present work an adsorbent called carbon embedded silica (CES) was developed by chemical modification of rice husk ash (RHA) and comparative study for Ni (II) removal was carried out. CES was characterized using techniques like EDAX, XRD, FTIR, XRF, and SEM. The specific surface area of CES was found out to be 100 m 2 /g and that of RHA as 44 m 2 /g. Batch experiments were performed to evaluate the influence of parameters like adsorbent dosage, initial pH, time, concentration of the adsorbate and temperature. It was observed that adsorption of Ni (II) followed pseudo second order kinetics in both the cases. Adsorption data fitted well with the Langmuir and Freundlich models. However, Langmuir isotherm displayed a better fitting. CES showed maximum 18 folds higher adsorption capacity over RHA. Thermodynamics parameters like heat of reaction, entropy of system and free energy were evaluated which confirms the feasibility of the process.
1	Abstract   The objective of the paper being presented is to develop a comprehensive mathematical model of a bagasse gasification unit integrated with a solid oxide fuel cell, to predict the system performance using the energy and exergy criteria. The model addresses the quasi-equilibrium approach of the gasifier and the electrochemical behavior of a solid oxide fuel cell fed with producer gas. The quasi-equilibrium approach is discussed based on the experimental data from a pilot bubbling gasifier for two biomass sources: sugar cane bagasse and rice husk. The model considers the effect of equilibrium temperature, carbon conversion, heat losses and tar removal in the gasifier and the in situ reforming, water gas shift and hydrogen conversion within cell electrodes. The best results are obtained at 1023 K and a 0.30 of air factor, under these conditions the total exergy efficiency is 35.20% and 58.85% of energy efficiency. After systems integration, the major exergy destruction is found in the gasifier ranging from 75% to 80% of the total loss.
1	Abstract   The full set of scaling laws derived by Glicksman allows the hydrodynamic scale-up of fluidized bed reactors. In case of catalytic bed materials, changing the particle diameter during scale-up may have consequences for mass transfer, catalyst activity, selectivity and deactivation behavior. For catalytic fluidized bed reactors of Geldart B particles with vertical internals such as heat exchanger tubes, a sectoral scale-up approach is tested, that shall help to avoid this dilemma of chemistry vs. hydrodynamics. It was found that at least two rows of tubes are needed around the measurement position to neglect outer wall effects and to reach similar hydrodynamic properties.
0	Abstract   TiO 2  thin film fabricated on window glass (soda-lime glass) demonstrates various promising applications, such as for the photodegradation of air pollutants like VOCs. However, the photocatalytic activity of the TiO 2  thin film fabricated on window glass through the currently reported traditional sol–gel method is relatively low, because usually it has poor crystallinity, which hinders its practical application. In this research, we have developed a facile and novel method to greatly improve the crystallinity and the photocatalytic activity of the TiO 2  thin film fabricated on window glass, that is the PVP (polyvinylpyrrolidone) modified sol–gel method. By simply adding 3%, 6% and 9% (weight percentage) PVP into titanium sol, the photocatalytic activities of the obtained TiO 2  thin films are 3.01, 4.37 and 3.33 times higher than that of the TiO 2  thin film fabricated without PVP for the photodegradation of acetone. As for the photodegradation of benzene, the photocatalytic activities of them are improved by 2.80, 4.62 and 3.07 times, respectively. Additionally, the obtained TiO 2  thin film also exhibits excellent photocatalytic stability, high visible light transmittance, firm adhesion and high photocatalytic activity under natural sunlight. These advantages demonstrate that it has the prospect of being large-scale applied on window glass for air purification under sunlight.
0	Abstract   In this study, ZnS nanocrystals (NCs) was synthesized and investigated as a novel sorbent for the copper removal from waste water. According to the adsorption experiments, the copper removal efficiency is over 99.0% in one minute. The saturated adsorption capacity of ZnS NCs sorbent on copper is about 650 mg/g which is closed to the theoretic adsorption capacity. The influence of pH value, other metal ions and NCs sorbent size on copper removal efficiency were investigated, respectively. The ZnS NCs sorbent was characterized by TEM and XPS to reveal the reaction mechanism. It was found that the NCs layer thickness played an important role in copper removal by ZnS NCs sorbent. It is more difficult to remove the copper from water for the sorbents with thicker NCs layer. Heat treatment method promoted the copper removal performance of sorbent greatly. Additionally, the sorbent and the copper removed by sorbent could be reclaimed easily. Therefore, it is a promising method to remove the copper from water by ZnS NCs sorbent.
0	Abstract   A novel anode Ti/TiO  x  H  y  /Sb−SnO 2  with excellent oxidation ability and long lifetime was successfully fabricated by introducing a TiO  x  H  y   interlayer through a simple way. The Ti substrate was modified through thermal oxidation followed by an electrochemical reduction process. Cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), accelerated lifetime test, scanning electron microscope (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were adopted to characterize its morphology, crystal structure and electrochemical properties. These studies indicated that TiO  x  H  y   interlayer played a critical role in improving electrode stability. Besides, the electrochemical oxidation of aniline in the NaCl and Na 2 SO 4  were both investigated to test the application of this Ti/TiO  x  H  y  /Sb−SnO 2  electrode. Results showed that nearly 70% of aniline could be degraded within 2 h. After characterization of the intermediates and products, a possible electrochemical degradation mechanism of aniline was proposed. It was worth noting that due to electro-polymerization, some nonconductive oligo(aniline)s could accumulate on the anode surface and lower the oxidation ability of the anode. However, the anode could be recovered repeatedly (at least 5 times) by essential electrochemical activation process, which also relied on the high electrode stability.
0	Abstract   In recent years, a tremendous research efforts have been triggered in order to develop efficient electrodes for responding to the increasing demand of high-performance electrodes for various renewable energy storage systems. Herein, we engineer a novel nanocomposites based on the cobalt sulfide (Co 3 S 4 ) particles warped in carbon nanotubes (CNTs)/reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanosheets via a low cost, facile, and one-pot hydrothermal method as an efficient electrode for high-performance supercapacitors. By investigating the effect of graphene oxide (GO) concentration and the ratio of GO/CNTs on the electrochemical performance of the electrodes, the rGO 100 -CNT 50 -Co 3 S 4  electrode was chosen as optimum electrode. This electrode exhibits excellent electrochemical performance with an ultrahigh specific capacitance of 977 F g −1  at 1 A g −1  and a remarkable rate capability of 63% after increasing the current density by a factor of 40. Furthermore, the charge-storage mechanism of the electrode was investigated by quantifying its kinetics, which reveals a surface redox behavior for this electrode. The fabricated asymmetric supercapacitor based on the rGO-CNT-Co 3 S 4  and N-doped graphene electrodes as the positive and the negative electrodes exhibits a maximum energy density of 43.5 Wh kg −1  and a power density up to 6.9 kW kg −1 . The superior electrochemical performance of this electrode was attributed to the synergic effects between the components.
0	Abstract   Lincomycin mycelial residues (LMRs), one kind of bio-wastes with a high biomass organic content, are limited to use due to residual lincomycin. Recycling of LMRs is not only benefit to economy but also to environment. This study developed an acidic hydrothermal method for LMRs treatment. Effects of reaction temperature (100, 130 and 160 °C), residence time (60, 120 and 180 min), and H 2 SO 4  concentration (0.2, 0.4 and 0.6 M) on the amount and distributions of organics, nitrogen and phosphorus were investigated. In addition, these three crucial parameters for maximum removal of lincomycin were optimized using response surface methodology (RSM). Meanwhile, intermediates of lincomycin treated by acidic hydrothermal treatment (AHT) were identified by liquid chromatography – mass spectrometry (LC/MS). Antibacterial assessments of them were conducted via disk diffusion tests. Results showed that the treatments led to 34.7%–251% and 30.9%–214% in the concentrations of TN and TP, respectively, and 1.44–3.89 times higher of SCOD in the soluble phase of LMRs. Lincomycin removal rates increased with the increasing of reaction temperature, residence time and H 2 SO 4  concentration in a certain range. The optimal conditions were obtained at activation temperature of 160 °C, residence time of 157.2 min and a H 2 SO 4  concentration of 0.53 M, where 98.3% of lincomycin was removed. Moreover, inhibition of lincomycin after AHT on  Staphyococcus aureus , with respect to untreated solutions containing this compound reduced significantly. Therefore, recycling of LMRs is promising after removal residual lincomycin via AHT.
1	Abstract   The present study concerns the separation of fine liquid–liquid dispersions having mean droplet diameters between 20 and 100 μm by phase inversion without bed formation. The influence of some operating parameters such as continuous phase flow rate, nozzle diameter and mean droplet diameter on the separation efficiency is studied. As can be seen, good operating conditions always lead to high separation efficiencies and all droplets having diameters above 50 μm can be practically removed. On the basis of a dimensional analysis relationships are given which allow designing separators based on the phase inversion method operating at low flow velocities in the nozzles according to the physical properties of the system, the separator characteristics, the droplet diameter and the desired efficiency.
0	Abstract   The recovery of zinc from chloride solutions using pseudo-emulsion based hollow fiber strip dispersion (PEHFSD) technique was investigated. The novel extractant, 1-(3-pyridyl)undecan-1-one oxime, and a well-known one, tributyl phosphate (TBP), were used in the processes. The influence of several parameters, including the initial concentration of Zn(II) and sodium chloride in the aqueous phase and the type of extractant on Zn(II) extraction was studied. The Zn(II) transport was analyzed on the basis of the overall mass transfer coefficient of permeation. The oxime was shown to be a potential carrier of zinc from chloride medium, being a promising alternative to the classical extractant TBP.
0	Abstract   In this study, the gas separation performance of polysulfone (PSF) hollow fiber mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) incorporated with nanotubes derived from titania were investigated. Titania nanotubes (TNTs) were synthesized via facile hydrothermal method of different reaction times: 10 h and 48 h. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and BET analysis were conducted to scrutinize the structural morphology of the as-synthesized TNTs. TNTs produced under prolonged reaction exhibited larger tube diameters, but have rather smaller pores. No functionalizations or modifications were made regarding the surface chemistry of the TNTs prior to blending with the spinning dope. Defect-free membranes were attained up to 0.6 wt% addition of TNT 10 . The measured permeances for all gases tested were profoundly increased with the addition of TNTs. PSF-TNT 10  0.4 wt% MMM recorded the highest permeance enhancement (about 150%), with H 2 , CO 2 , O 2  permeance of 269 GPU, 120 GPU, and 26 GPU, respectively, with O 2 /N 2 , H 2 /CH 4 , CO 2 /CH 4 , and CO 2 /N 2  selectivity remained higher than the neat membrane. TNT 48  MMM demonstrated relatively lower fluxes but higher selectivity which ascribed to its smaller internal tube diameter endowing better size-exclusion capability. The TNTs formation mechanisms were discussed to justify the evolution of gas separation performance of TNT-incorporated MMMs. In light of the findings, hydrothermal method can be regarded as a versatile technique for producing TNTs of different morphologies simply by manipulating its reaction parameters. On top of that, TNTs being a low cost material, it holds enormous potential to be widely exploited in gas separation applications.
1	Abstract   In this work, a simple coating method was employed to prepare a highly stable graphene oxide (GO) membrane for oil-in-water emulsions separation. By using mussel inspired polydopamine (PDA) as covalent linker, mixed cellulose ester membrane (MCEM) was successfully modified with PDA layer by self-polymerize, then GO nanosheets were attracted onto PDA/MCEM by simple vacuum filtration method, lead to the formation of GO/PDA/MCEM. The as-prepared membranes were characterized by FT-IR, TEM, AFM and contact angle, respectively. The results indicated that GO layer was uniformly coated on the support, and GO/PDA/MCEM had a rough surface and good hydrophilic property. Attributing to both the high adhesive ability of PDA and possible covalent interaction between GO and PDA, GO/PDA/MCEM was highly stable by being immersed in water environment for 12 h. GO/PDA/MCEM was employed to separate Tween-80 stabilized oil-in-water emulsions. The results showed that the prepared GO/PDA/MCEM had effective separation performance and reusability in the oil-in-water emulsions filtration for four cycles. This study provided a feasible, simple and economical way to prepare a highly stable GO-based membrane for oil-in-water emulsions filtration.
1	Abstract   An experimental verification and validation of the neural-network rate-function (NNRF) approach to modeling dynamic systems is provided. The NNRF modeling scheme utilizes the designed experimental data to build the interested states of the dynamic system as a function of the related recurrent states and the external inputs by feedforward artificial neural networks (FANNs). Once these FANNs are trained, they can be put back into the original differential equations, thereby turning out this combined NNRF-differential-equation model. The experimental system for demonstrating the applicability of the NNRF modeling approach is the liquid phase cultivation of Monascus anka. In a 5 l batch reactor system, the controlled inputs are the cultivating temperature and the dissolved oxygen; the desired outputs are the glucoamylase activity and the concentration of red pigment. Based on the developed sequential pseudo-uniform design (SPUD) method, 11 batches are adequate to provide the identified NNRF model with sufficient information. Facing the noisy inputs and outputs, the identified NNRF demonstrates its predictive capability and could be applied to determine the optimal operating conditions for the submerged cultivation of M. anka.
1	Abstract   This paper reports an experimental investigation of the vortex shedding wake behind a long flat plate inclined at a small angle of attack to a main flow stream. Detailed velocity fields are obtained with particle-image velocimetry (PIV) at successive phases in a vortex shedding cycle at three angles of attack, α=20°, 25° and 30°, at a Reynolds number Re≈5,300. Coherent patterns and dynamics of the vortices in the wake are revealed by the phase-averaged PIV vectors and derived turbulent properties. A vortex street pattern comprising a train of leading edge vortices alternating with a train of trailing edge vortices is found in the wake. The trailing edge vortex is shed directly from the sharp trailing edge while there are evidences that the formation and shedding of the leading edge vortex involve a more complicated mechanism. The leading edge vortex seems to be shed into the wake from an axial location near the trailing edge. After shedding, the vortices are convected downstream in the wake with a convection speed roughly equal to 0.8 the free-stream velocity. On reaching the same axial location, the trailing edge vortex, as compared to the leading edge vortex, is found to possess a higher peak vorticity level at its centre and induce more intense fluid circulation and Reynolds stresses production around it. It is found that the results at the three angles of attack can be collapsed into similar trends by using the projected plate width as the characteristic length of the flow.
0	Abstract   Cationic variants of zeolite Y (LiY, NaY, KY, RbY, CsY, CaY, LaY and HY) were prepared via aqueous ion exchange. High-temperature calorimetry was used to study the integral hydration enthalpy and the enthalpy of formation from the constituent oxides. For the alkali cation-exchanged zeolites, the total energetic contribution by hydration decreases in the order LiY&gt;NaY&gt;RbY&gt;CsY. However, the average hydration enthalpy per mole of water has little dependence on the nature of the exchanged cations. In the presence of smaller cations (higher ionic potential), water molecules can be packed more efficiently in zeolite cavities, and the average hydration number (H2O/M) is higher. The low hydration enthalpy of KY relative to the trend of the zeolites exchanged with other alkali cations may be due to the absence of a stable cation–water arrangement in sodalite cages. The enthalpy of formation of a zeolite from its constituent oxides becomes more exothermic as the basicity of the exchanged cations increases. For the alkali cation exchanged zeolites, the enthalpies of formation can be correlated to the average ionic potential, (Z/r)av. The standard formation enthalpies of the ion-exchanged zeolites from constituent elements at 25°C were derived by combining the calorimetric data with literature data. The hydration enthalpies and enthalpies of formation of CaY, LaY and HY are also presented.
1	In this paper, a method of utilizing the carbonized micron wood fiber (CMWF) as the filter material is presented and a corresponding numerical simulation method is applied. Furthermore, a kind of detachable diesel particulate filters (DPF) is developed, a diesel engine bench test is conducted and the influence elements upon Δp/H are researched. Theory and test show that the smaller the average micro pore diameter is, the larger the focal length of parabola is, which means that the numerical simulation method can be consistent with the test very well. Meanwhile, a lot of tests prove that the DPF filters with bigger pore diameter and longer length should take priority over the others, together with the increase of the filter length, the PM arresting efficiency will be improved and Δp/H also climbs up rapidly and a kind of modified CMWF DPF, of which the micro pore diameter reduces gradually from entry to exit end, possesses high filtration efficiency and low pressure drop and be suited to filter the exhaust gases of diesel.
0	Abstract   Heats of adsorption measured by flow microcalorimetry (FMC) were used to understand the energetics of biomolecule adsorption on mesostructured cellular foam (MCF) silica. Tryptophan (Trp), lysozyme (LYS), and bovine serum albumin (BSA) were used as probe molecules. The FMC results confirmed that attractive interactions (both electrostatic and van der Walls interactions) between the biomolecules and acid-washed MCF silica were the driving force for adsorption, even when the protein (BSA) and the surface were both negatively charged and repulsion interactions might be expected. Multiple exothermic events occurred, possibly because of multipoint interactions between biomolecules and MCF silica resulting from multiple binding sites on the biomolecule and a curved pore structure. Interestingly, the magnitude of the enthalpy of adsorption (Δ H  Total ) increased with increasing biomolecule size at pH 5.2; the number of exothermic peaks corresponded to the number of binding regions on the biomolecule. In addition, standard Gibbs energies of adsorption (Δ G °) and entropy of adsorption (Δ S °) were calculated from batch adsorption isotherms and the measured enthalpy of adsorption. BSA adsorption energetics were significantly affected by changing the pH from 4 to 5.2. This effect was attributed to a dramatic conformational change of BSA as a function of pH. The energetics of adsorption provide invaluable insight into the mechanism biomolecule adsorption.
1	Abstract   The current study investigates the augmentation in the laminar forced convection characteristics of the backward-facing step flow in a two-dimensional channel by means of introducing an adiabatic circular cylinder in the domain. The effects of various cross-stream positions (i.e., yc = 0–1.5) of the circular cylinder on the flow and heat transfer characteristics of the backward-facing step flow has been numerically explored for the Reynolds number range 1–200 and Prandtl number of 0.71 (air). The governing continuity, Navier–Stokes and energy equations along with appropriate boundary conditions are solved by using FLUENT. The flow and thermal fields have been explained by streamline and isotherm profiles, respectively; however, no temperature dependency effects are considered for the flow viscosity and thermal conductivity. The engineering parameters like wake/recirculation length, total drag coefficient and average Nusselt number, etc. are calculated for the above range of conditions. The present results show an enhancement in the peak Nusselt value of up to 155% using a circular cylinder as compared to the unobstructed case (i.e., without cylinder). Finally, simple correlations for total drag coefficient and peak Nusselt number are obtained for the above range of conditions.
0	Abstract   Several MnO2n−1 phases with M=Ti+V, have been studied, mainly by means of transmission electron microscopy and associated techniques. For n=3, a ternary phase Ti2VO5 was found with pseudobrookite structure and a=0.9813(1) nm, b=0.37763(4) nm, c=0.9957(2) unit cell parameters. Structural images along the short axis show crystals with lamellae defects inside the basic matrix of M3O5. The structure of those defects correspond to M5O9 (n=5, Ti3.7V1.3O9), with same a and b axes and a c axis of 1.67 nm. The structure of this defect can be described as an ordered intergrowth of pseudobrookite and anatase at the unit cell level. Some crystals present n=2 phases, (Ti,V)2O3, with corundum type-structure which is intergrown with lamellae defects apparently formed by exsolution from the corundum matrix. In some cases, the intergrown slabs present a sinusoidal wave-like contrast which is reminiscent of high-temperature crystallographic shear planes in rutile. At 1373 K we observed the well known MnO2n−1 Andersson phases (M=Ti+V) with n=6, 7 and 8 intergrown in the same crystal.
0	Abstract   The effects of precursor solution concentration, composition, and spin-processing parameters on the thickness and electrical properties of ultra-smooth aluminum oxide phosphate (Al2O3−3x(PO4)2x or “AlPO”) thin films prepared using aqueous solutions are reported. Compositions were verified by electron probe micro-analysis and range from Al2O1.5(PO4) to AlPO4 (x = P:Al from 0.5 to 1.0). Film thicknesses were determined using X-ray reflectivity measurements and were found to depend systematically on solution concentration, P:Al ratio, and spin-speed. Metal-insulator-semiconductor devices were fabricated to determine electrical properties as a function of composition. As the P:Al ratio increased from 0.5 to 1.0, the dielectric constant decreased from 6.0 to 4.6, leakage currents increased from 0.45 to 65 nA cm−2 at 1 MV cm−1 and dielectric breakdown (defined as leakage currents &gt;10 μA cm−2) decreased from 9.74 to 2.84 MV cm−1. These results establish composition, concentration, and spin-speed for the production of AlPO films with targeted thicknesses and electrical properties.
1	Abstract   When rat protein kinase C-δ (PKC-δ) was produced by Sf9 cells infected with a recombinant baculovirus in shake-flask culture using a serum-containing medium, the intracellular PKC-δ content decreased in the late period while the extracellular PKC-6 markedly increased. During the late period of serum-free culture, the extracellular PKC-6 level considerably declined, but the addition of a protease inhibitor, leupeptin, prevented the reduction in PKC-δ production.
1	Albumin is the major plasma protein and acts as a physiological carrier for various compounds including drugs. To take advantage of the drug-binding ability of albumin for a drug delivery system, we have prepared hydrogels consisting of acrylamide (AAm) and bovine serum albumin (BSA) by introducing three to four vinyl groups into one BSA molecule and subsequently copolymerizing it with AAm. The resultant hydrogel was solubilized by trypsin treatment, since BSA served as a crosslinker in the hydrogel. The BSA-crosslinked hydrogel (BSA-AAm hydrogel) was loaded with salicylic acid or sodium benzoate and their release was investigated. The BSA-AAm hydrogel released much more salicylic acid than sodium benzoate. In addition, the amount of released salicylic acid increased with the BSA content of the hydrogel, despite a decrease in the swelling ratio of the hydrogel. On the other hand, the amount of released sodium benzoate increased with the swelling ratio. When a hydrogel crosslinked with  N,N ′-methylenebis (acrylamide) was used as a control, both drugs showed release tendencies similar to that of sodium benzoate from the BSA-AAm hydrogel. Furthermore, the salicylic acid release was sustained longer on the BSA-AAm hydrogel than the sodium benzoate release. Taken together, it is thought that albumin in the BSA-AAm hydrogel preferentially adsorbs salicylic acid and contributes to the high drug loading and the sustained release of salicylic acid.
1	Abstract   We previously demonstrated the stoichiometric conversion of glycerol to glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P) using Escherichia coli recombinants producing the ATP-dependent glycerol kinase of the hyperthermophile Thermococcus kodakaraensis (TkGK) and the polyphosphate kinase of Thermus thermophilus HB27 (TtPPK). TtPPK was associated with the membrane fraction of E. coli recombinants, whereas TkGK was released from the cells during the reaction at 70°C. In this study, TkGK was fused with either TtPPK or an E. coli membrane-intrinsic protein, YedZ, to minimize the heat-induced leakage of TkGK. When the E. coli recombinants having these fusion proteins were incubated at 70°C for 2 h, more than 80% of TkGK activity was retained in the heated E. coli cells. However, the yields of G3P production by E. coli having the fusion proteins of TtPPK and TkGK were only less than 35%. Polyphosphate is a strong chelator for metal ions and has an inhibitory effect on TkGK which requires magnesium. Insufficient space between TtPPK and TkGK might enhance the inhibitory effect of polyphosphate on TkGK activity of the fusion protein. The mixture of E. coli cells having TtPPK and those having TkGK fused with YedZ converted 80% of glycerol into G3P. These recombinant cells could be easily recovered from the reaction mixture by centrifugation and repeatedly used without a significant loss of enzyme activities.
1	Although the reconstruction of functional 3D liver tissue models in vitro presents numerous challenges, it is in great demand for drug development, regenerative medicine, and physiological studies. Here we propose a new approach to perform perfusion cultivation of liver cells by assembling cell-laden hydrogel microfibers. HepG2 cells were densely packed into the core of sandwich-type anisotropic microfibers, which were produced using microfluidic devices. The obtained microfibers were bundled up and packed into a perfusion chamber, and perfusion cultivation was performed. We evaluated cell viability and functions, and also monitored the oxygen consumption. Furthermore, fibers covered with vascular endothelial cells were united during the perfusion culture, to form vascular network-like conduits between fibers. The presented technique can structurally mimic the hepatic lobule in vivo and could prove to be a useful model for various biomedical research applications.
0	Abstract   Magnetic carbon spheres have been successfully prepared by the synchronous carbonation and activation of the 8-quinoliolato Fe(III) complexe with sphere morphology, which has been synthesized by solovthermal method. The obtained composite possesses relatively even pore diameter of 3.8 nm, high surface area of 335.59 m 2 /g with 52.67 wt.% Fe 3 O 4  coated, and a saturation magnetization (Ms) of 35.27 emu/g. Dye separation performance of the magnetic carbon spheres is investigated using methylene orange and methylene blue as modle. The resluts show that the maxium adsorption capacity for methylene orange and methylene blue is 128.70 mg g −1  and 151.29 mg g −1 , respectively, and the process can rapidly reach adsorption equilibrium within 5 min, which is important for the application of the as-prepared magnetic carbon spheres.
0	Abstract   An approach to the simultaneous reclamation of carbon and sulfur resources from CO 2  and H 2 S has been proposed and effectively implemented with the aid of catalysts. A brief thermodynamic study reveals the potential of direct reduction of CO 2  with H 2 S (15:15 mol% balanced with N 2 ) for selective production of CO and elemental sulfur. The experiments carried out in a fixed-bed flow reactor over the temperature range of 400–800 °C give evidence of the importance of the employment of catalysts. Both the conversions of the reactants and the selectivities of the target products can be substantially promoted over most catalysts studied. Nevertheless, little difference appears among their catalytic performance. The results also prove that the presence of CO 2  can remarkably enhance H 2 S conversion and the sulfur yield in comparison with H 2 S direct decomposition. A longtime reaction test on MgO catalyst manifests its superior durability at high temperature (700 °C) and huge gas hourly space velocity (100,000 h −1 ). Free radicals initiated by catalysts are supposed to dominate the reactions between CO 2  and H 2 S.
0	Abstract   The work presents the X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) technique for measuring the X-ray absorption coefficient of NiCO 3  in the X-ray energy range of 8271.2 to 8849.4 eV using scanning EXAFS beam line (BL-09) at Indus-2 synchrotron radiation source facility, Raja Ramanna Centre for Advanced Technology (RRCAT) at Indore, India. The result represents the absorption coefficient data for NiCO 3  in the XAFS region of K-edge of Ni. However, the results are compared to theoretical predictions obtained from X-COM and FFAST methods. There is a maximum deviation which is found exactly near the K-edge jump and decreases as we move away from the absorption edge.
1	Abstract   Energy conversion is one of the inevitable parts of any industries. It involves either conversion of mechanical energy in to electrical or vice versa. The later conversion of energy i.e. electrical to mechanical emphasizes the need of motor .Statistics reveals, about 8% of industries’ annual turnover met on maintenance. Thus substantial numbers of efforts are required tominimize in incurringexpenditure met towards break down maintenance. Condition monitoring is one of such techniques based on vibration widely used to recognize premature failures and paves a way to minimize cumbersome involved during breakdown of machinery. The present investigation involves a case study of squirrel cage induction motor (frequently in the electro machines) has been chosen for the conditional monitoringtopredict its soundness on the basis of results of FFT analyser. Accelerometer which measures the acceleration converts in to impulses by FFT analyser generates vibration spectrum and time spectrum has been located at various positions on motor under different conditions. Results obtained from the FFT analyser are compared to that ofISO standard vibration severity charts aretaken to predict the preventative condition of considered machinery. Initial inspection of motor revealed that stator faults, broken end rings in rotor, eccentricity faults and misalignment between bearings are trouble shootings areas for present investigation. From the results of the shaft frequencies, it can be perceived that there is a misalignment between the bearings at both the ends. The higher order harmonics of FTF shows the presence of cracks on the race of the bearings at both the ends which are in the incipient stage. Replacement of the bearings at both the drive end (6306) and non drive end(6206) and the alignment check between the bearings in the shaft are suggested as the constructive measures towards preventive maintenance of considered squirrel cage induction motor.
0	Abstract   The corrosion resistance of Al–Fe coatings increases as a protective LiAlO 2  layer forms. If, however, the Al–Fe coatings lack sufficient aluminium for maintaining this protective layer, the corrosion resistance of the coating is degraded by the growth of non-protective scales, such as LiFeO 2 . In this study, the degradation behaviour of Al–Fe coatings is investigated in the wet-seal environment of molten carbonate fuel cells (MCFC). Al–Fe coated specimens with various amounts of aluminium in the range 8–70 at.% and bulk specimens of Fe–23.9 Al (at.%) are prepared. A corrosion test is performed in Li/K carbonate systems at 650 °C with a single-cell and an immersion test. Test results reveal that aluminium contents in the coatings should be higher than 25 at.% in order to form and maintain a protective LiAlO 2  layer. In addition to aluminium content, the influence of microstructural features on the degradation behaviour of Al–Fe coatings is discussed.
0	Abstract   Different types of graphite materials, i.e. synthetic graphite flakes and natural graphite flakes which are used as anode materials in Li-ion batteries were studied. Differences in the electrochemical behavior of electrodes comprised of these materials, mainly in their irreversible capacity, could be correlated to the differences in the particle morphologies and their crystal structure. We propose that graphite particles with a large amount of crevices in their edge planes can crack, due to a build-up of internal pressure as a result of reduction of solution species on the carbon surfaces during the first cathodic polarization on the electrodes. Another important factor determining the electrodes’ stability is the existence of some disorder in the particles’ structure.
1	Abstract   The Quraishi–Fahidy method [Can. J. Chem. Eng. 59 (1981) 563] was employed to derive characteristic dimensionless numbers for the membrane-electrolyte, cathode catalyst layer and gas diffuser, respectively, based on the model presented by Bernardi and Verbrugge for polymer electrolyte fuel cells [AIChE J. 37 (1991) 1151]. Monomial correlations among dimensionless numbers were developed and tested against experimental and mathematical modeling results. Dimensionless numbers comparing the bulk and surface-convective ionic conductivities, the electric and viscous forces and the current density and the fixed surface charges, were employed to describe the membrane ohmic drop and its non-linear dependence on current density due to membrane dehydration. The analysis of the catalyst layer yielded electrode kinetic equivalents of the second Damkohler number and Thiele modulus, influencing the penetration depth of the oxygen reduction front based on the pseudohomogeneous film model. The correlating equations for the catalyst layer could describe in a general analytical form, all the possible electrode polarization scenarios such as electrode kinetic control coupled or not with ionic and/or oxygen mass transport limitation. For the gas diffusion-backing layer correlations are presented in terms of the Nusselt number for mass transfer in electrochemical systems. The dimensionless number-based correlating equations for the membrane electrode assembly (MEA) could provide a practical approach to quantify single-cell polarization results obtained under a variety of experimental conditions and to implement them in models of the fuel cell stack.
0	A procedure to predict the state of charge of a lithium ion cell using experimental data (cell potential versus time), as it becomes available, is presented. The procedure is based on the physics of the system and provides a realistic estimate of the state of charge of the cell as a function of time, for a given set of properties of the electrodes. An electrochemical cell model is used to obtain an extended Kalman filter (EKF) for estimating the state of charge (SOC) of a lithium ion cell in which the negative electrode is the limiting electrode. The method could also be used for a cell in which the positive electrode is limiting.
0	In this paper, it is reported for the first time that a carbon-supported Pd-P (Pd-P/C) catalyst for the anodic catalyst in the direct formic acid fuel cell (DFAFC) can be prepared. The Pd-P/C catalyst shows that its electrocatalytic activity and especially its stability for the oxidation of formic acid are much higher than that of a Pd/C catalyst. Therefore, the Pd-P/C catalyst may have practical applications in DFAFCs.
0	Abstract   Based on measurements of the streaming potential coefficient, hydraulic permeability and ion conductivity the electrokinetic energy conversion of nanoporous ion conductive Nafion®117 polymer membrane has been evaluated. A high figure-of-merit of 1.1 ± 0.2 has been found in 0.03 M aqueous LiCl solution that corresponds to an electrokinetic energy conversion efficiency of approximately 18 ± 2%. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study in the literature designated to the electrokinetic energy conversion in materials where the pores have high surface charge density. The initial results are promising with respect to future electrokinetic generator or pump applications and highly charged polymer membranes might be a future pathway for low-cost high-efficiency electrokinetic energy conversion.
0	Abstract   The effect of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on a Li anode on the charge–discharge cycling performance in 1 M LiTFSI/dimethylsulfoxide electrolyte solution is examined by using charge–discharge cycling. The chemical structure of the surface and interior of the SEI strongly affects the cycling performance of the anode. The observed coulombic efficiency is low ( 2 CO 3 , Li 2 O, and LiF form instead, the coulombic efficiency increases to &gt;85%. This enhanced efficiency remains constant regardless of the O 2  content and despite  2 O in the electrolyte. Thus, the lithium surface should be protected by inorganic compounds prior to cycling to prevent it from undergoing side reactions with the electrolyte during cycling in the electrolyte.
0	Abstract   Chemical composition modifications of a Laves phase-related BCC solid solution base alloy, Ti15.6Zr2.1V44Cr11.2Mn6.9Fe2.7Co1.4Ni15.7Al0.3, were investigated in order to study the function of each constituent element on the structural, gaseous phase and electrochemical hydrogen storage properties of these alloys. In general, removal of Fe and decrease in V-content in exchange for higher Ni-content were found to improve both the electrochemical capacity and high-rate dischargeability, which are related to the decrease in C14-content and increase in TiNi-content. However, total elimination of the C14 phase by removal of Zr resulted in a reduced discharge capacity, a prolonged activation period, and a less catalytic surface for electrochemical reaction. Besides the BCC and C14 phases, the TiNi phase was also found in every alloy in this study, contributing positively to the bulk diffusion of hydrogen while hindering the surface electrochemical reaction.
0	Alkenes are known to react with hydrogen-terminated silicon surfaces to produce robust organic monolayers that are attached to the surface via covalent SiC bonds. In this report we investigate the dependence of the rate of alkylation of porous silicon samples on the reaction time using photochemical initiation. The kinetics of the photochemical alkylation of hydrogen-terminated porous silicon by undec-1-ene in toluene were observed to be pseudo first order, however the apparent rate constant decreased as the concentration of undec-1-ene increased. This behaviour is opposite to what would be expected if the rate-limiting process was an elementary chemical reaction step involving the alkene. Instead, it suggests that transport of the alkene to reactive sites and in the correct orientation is the rate-limiting step. Comparison of the rates of alkylation of porous silicon by undec-1-ene and dimethoxytrityl (DMT)–undecenol is consistent with such an interpretation as the bulky DMT headgroup gives a lower rate of alkylation. The diffusion of some simple redox-active probe molecules in porous silicon was investigated using a scanning electrochemical microscope (SECM). The probe molecules are converted at diffusion-controlled rate at an inlaid disk ultramicroelectrode (UME) consisting of the cross-section of a microwire sealed in glass. If the microelectrode is placed a short distance above the porous silicon, the microelectrode current depends on kinetics of the electrochemical reactions at the porous silicon and the mass transport properties within the open thin layer cell formed by the microelectrode and the alkylated porous silicon. In order to differentiate the effects of finite heterogeneous kinetics at silicon from diffusion limitations, current–distance curves were fitted over a wide range of applied potentials (on the Si) and it was observed that the diffusion coefficient in the porous layer was strongly anisotropic. The measured diffusion rates are comparable to those in bulk water along the pores, but with negligible diffusion between pores. This indicates that few pore–pore interconnections exist in the porous silicon.
0	In this study, the LiCoO 2 /LiNi 1/3 Mn 1/3 Co 1/3 O 2  mixed cathode electrodes were prepared and their electrochemical performances were measured in a high cut-off voltage. As the contents of LiNi 1/3 Mn 1/3 Co 1/3 O 2  in the mixed cathode increases, the reversible specific capacity and cycleability of the electrode enhanced, but the rate capability deteriorated. On the contrary, the rate capability of the cathode enhanced but the reversible specific capacity and cycleability deteriorated, according to increasing the contents of LiCoO 2  in the mixed cathode. The cell of LiCoO 2 /LiNi 1/3 Mn 1/3 Co 1/3 O 2  (50:50, wt.%) mixed cathode delivers a discharge capacity of ca. 168 mAh/g at a 0.2 C rate. The capacity of the cell decreased with the current rate and a useful capacity of ca. 152 mAh/g was obtained at a 2.0 C rate. However, the cell shows very stable cycleability: the discharge capacity of the cell after 20th charge/discharge cycling maintains ca. 163 mAh/g.
0	Abstract   The pitting corrosion of carbon steel in carbonate-formation water solution in the presence of chloride ions and the effect of addition WO 4  2− , MoO 4  2−  and NO 2  −  anions on the pitting corrosion were studied using cyclic voltammetry and potentiostatic current–time measurements and complemented by scan electron microscope (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) investigations. Cyclic voltammograms of carbon steel in the presence of chloride ions in carbonate-formation water solution show one anodic peak, corresponding to the formation green rust carbonate and the two cathodic peaks. As the addition of Cl −  ions concentration increases, the anodic peak current density increases and pitting potential  E  pit  shifts to more negative potential. It is shown that the rate of pit initiation (    t  i   −  1     ) decreases and the pitting potential  E  pit  moves to more positive direction upon the addition of inorganic anions. It was found that pitting inhibition of carbon steel increases in the sequence: (WO 4 ) 2−  &gt; (MoO 4 ) 2−  &gt; (NO 2 ) − .
0	The influence of different concentrations of phosphate ions on the corrosive behavior of a CoCrMo alloy is investigated. The study is conducted using electrochemical techniques (polarization and potentiodynamic measurements, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). It was found that phosphate ions are vastly responsible for the blocking of the active surface with the addition of calf serum having little effect. This is in contrast to titanium where the competition between the adsorption mechanisms of proteins and those relating to phosphate ions was evidenced recently. The formation and quantification of CrO4 2− as a result of a dissolution of Cr2O3 oxide layer was evidenced using UV/vis absorption spectroscopy.
0	Abstract   The simultaneous voltammetric determination of dihydroxybenzene isomers was investigated using cyclic and differential pulse voltammetries at the amino-functionalized SBA-15 mesoporous silica-modified carbon paste electrode (NH 2 -SBA15/CPE) in phosphate buffer solution (pH 6.0). The NH 2 -SBA15/CPE showed a larger peak current and higher selectivity for the dihydroxybenzene isomers in comparison with the bare carbon paste electrode (CPE) and SBA-15 mesoporous silica-modified carbon paste electrode (SBA15/CPE). The oxidation peak potential difference between hydroquinone (HQ) and catechol (CC) was 115 mV and was 396 mV between catechol and resorcinol (RC). This indicated that catechol, resorcinol and hydroquinone could be identified entirely at the NH 2 -SBA15/CPE. Under the optimized conditions, the amperometric currents were linear over ranges from the following: 0.8–160 μmol L −1  for hydroquinone, 1.0–140 μmol L −1  for catechol and 2.0–160 μmol L −1  for resorcinol. The detection limits were 0.3, 0.5 and 0.8 μmol L −1 , respectively. The proposed electrode can be applied to the simultaneous determination of dihydroxybenzene isomers in mixtures without previous chemical or physical separations.
0	Abstract   Ionic conductivity in nanocomposite electrolytes is examined through the use of a numerical model. A rigorous description of the space charge layer and its impact on conductivity are developed for a composite system consisting of insulating spheres dispersed within an ion conducting material. Model simulations are performed to understand how the effective conductivity, which can exceed the conductivity of the bulk material, depends on the volume fraction, size, configuration, and particle size distribution of the nanoparticles in the bulk material. Several deliberately chosen regular particle configurations are used to establish the lower and upper bounds for conductivity enhancement. A simple cubic array of particles is demonstrated to provide a reasonable estimate for the behavior expected from a random distribution of particles. Finally, conductivity modulation is shown to be significant when the particle radius is comparable to or smaller than the thickness of the space charge layer.
0	Abstract   Titania nanotube (TNT) array was fabricated by anodization of titanium in 0.2 wt.% HF aqueous solution. The as-anodized TNT was crystallized to anatase phase with a heat treatment at 450 °C. CoO/TNT nanocomposite was synthesized by cathodic deposition over the annealed TNT in 0.05 M Co(NO 3 ) 2 . The surface morphology and crystalline structure of the resultant CoO/TNT nanocomposite were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectrum and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). The influences of deposition time and current density on the surface morphology of CoO/TNT were studied. The photoelectrochemical response of CoO/TNT nanocomposite was investigated. All CoO/TNT exhibited higher photocurrent than bare annealed TNT did, which was caused by the enhanced photogenerated electron–hole pairs separation. However, the photocatalytic activity cannot be straightforwardly related to photocurrent response because it also depends on some other factors such as catalyst acidic properties, specific surface area and the adsorption of organic dye. Transient photocurrent measurement should not be used alone for the screening of photocatalytic materials.
0	Abstract   How to improve the power density of olivine LiFePO4 has recently become one of the most attractive topics of both scientific and industrial interests. Therefore, nanostructured electrodes have been widely investigated to satisfy such needs. However, the complicated and high-temperature sintering process is usually involved for preparing high-performance cathode materials based on high-quality crystals. In order to solve these problems, here, a promising LiFePO4/C composite electrode material is synthesized by an in situ carbothermal reduction method at low temperature using a low-cost Fe3+ salt as the iron source, soluble starch sol as carbon sources and reducing agent. The synthesized LiFePO4/C composite shows highly crystalline, ultrafine sphere-like particles and a desirable core–shell structure with uniform carbon film on the surface of nano-crystal LiFePO4, which could inherit the morphology of FePO4 precursor. Galvanostatic battery testing shows that LiFePO4/C composite delivers 161 and 122 mAh/g at 0.2 C and 5 C rates, respectively, and exhibits desirable capacity retention after 500 cycles at 5 C. Remarkably, even at a high current density of 20 C, the cell still presents good cycle retention.
0	Abstract   A facile method has been developed to synthesize Ti 3+ -doped TiO 2  nanoparticles as high-performance anode materials for Li-ion batteries. After reducing some Ti 4+  ions to Ti 3+  ions with zinc powders in TiCl 4  solution, Ti 3+ -doped TiO 2  was synthesized by solvothermal methode. The obtained Ti 3+ -doped TiO 2  nanoparticles are relatively uniform and better dispersed with an average size of 30 nm. Great improvement of the electrochemical performance was obtained by Ti 3+ -doping comparing with the pure TiO 2 . The Ti 3+ -doped TiO 2  nanoparticles prepared at the Zn:Ti molar ratio of 4% are able to deliver a reversible capacity of 202.1 mAh g −1  at a current density of 100 mA g −1  and exhibit superior high-rate discharge/charge capability and cycling stability at the current density up to 3000 mA g −1  in a half cell configuration. The improved reversible capacity and rate capability could be ascribed to the presence of Ti 3+ , which improves the electrical conductivity and reduces the charge transfer resistance of the TiO 2  electrode.
0	Abstracts   Accurate determination of limiting molar conductivity ( Λ  0 ) value for an electrolyte at infinite dilution is an important physical quantity that reviews the strength of an electrolyte. Therefore, in this study, a power law comprised of a double-logarithmic plot of electrolytic conductivity ( κ ) and salt concentration ( C  salt ) has been introduced to determine  Λ  0  accurately at a corresponding reference salt concentration ( C  ref ). Furthermore, the reliability of the experimental data is verified after Kohlrausch's law for LiClO 4  (aq.) at 25.0 °C which is perfectly identical with the reference data. The workability of the power law is tested for LiClO 4  (aq.) and LiClO 4  in acetonitrile (ACN) at a range of C salt  at 25.0 °C. Thus, the  Λ  0  for both systems correspond at 106 and 177.4 S cm 2  mol −1  respectively, after the power law deviated only 2% of the reported value. From the study, it is noted that the corresponding  C  ref  is approximately half of the lowest  C  salt  concentration that obeys the power law at infinite dilution which responds to  Λ  0  for an electrolyte system. This alternative method shows a nice linearity for  C  salt  (10 −5  - 10 −9  mol cm −3 ) between the experimental and reference data before it deviates from the linearity above  C  salt  &gt; 10 −5  mol cm −3 .
0	Abstract   Pore-arrayed hydrogen tungsten bronze (p-H x WO 3 ) is fabricated with polystyrene as template by electrodeposition and used as the support of platinum nanoparticles as electrocatalyst (Pt/p-H x WO 3 ) for methanol oxidation. The surface morphology, structure, and compositions of p-H x WO 3  and Pt/p-H x WO 3  are characterized with scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The activity and stability of Pt/p-H x WO 3  toward methanol oxidation are evaluated in 0.5 M H 2 SO 4  + 1.0 M CH 3 OH solution by cyclic voltammetry (CV), chronoamperometry (CA), and chronopotentiometry (CP), and cell discharge test. The characterizations from SEM, XRD, TEM, and FTIR demonstrate that p-H x WO 3  contains uniform pores of about 200 nm and the platinum particles can be uniformly distributed with an average size of 3.01 nm on it. The electrochemical evaluations indicate that Pt/p-H x WO 3  exhibits better activity and stability toward methanol oxidation than the platinum supported by non-pore arrayed H x WO 3 .
1	Tubular photobioreactors (PBR) have great potential for microalgae cultivation due to its high productivity compared with open ponds. However, the energy uptake for fluid circulation and mixing is significant, impacting the operation and production costs. In this work, we investigate by CFD simulation the effect of wall turbulence promoters, i.e. profiles at the inner tube wall, at low flow velocities (0.1–0.3 m/s). The use of these wall turbulence promoters is compared to the mixing behaviour in standard tubular PBRs at flow velocity of 0.5 m/s. It was found that the wall turbulence promoters have at flow velocities of 0.2–0.25 m/s better mixing behaviour as in standard PBRs while the energy uptake is 60–80% lower.
1	Abstract   This paper, which illustrates some results of the project SO.L.E.AGRI. (“Wood-energy chain sustainability in agricultural sector”) funded by Provincia di Siena and of the PRIN 2005–2006 “Study of the biomass-energy chains in Italy” funded by the Italian Ministry of Instruction, University and Research, highlights that the use of agricultural residuals as renewable energy source is economically and environmentally convenient.  This work firstly looks at the energy use of agricultural residuals harvested, and then it considers their packaging and supply management. The main objective of the production of the solid bio-fuels originated from pruning residuals is the reduction of harvesting and transport costs; therefore, experimental tests have been carried out in different farms using an innovative shredding machine that simultaneously permits harvesting, shredding and packaging of pruning residuals. These trials have been undertaken in olive groves and vineyards, on stony and hilly terrain. The machine has obtained good results under different operative conditions: intensive mechanisation of harvesting implies lower costs and simultaneous packaging assures a better organisation of the whole energy chain.
1	Microalgae have been investigated as a promising biodiesel feedstock; however, large-scale production is not currently cost-competitive with petroleum diesel, and its environmental impacts have received little attention. Using wastewater to supply nutrients for algal growth obviates synthetic fertilizer use, provides on-site nutrient removal, and reduces greenhouse gas emissions. In this work, anaerobically digested dairy manure was used to grow the oleaginous green alga Neochloris oleoabundans. In batch culture experiments with both synthetic media and anaerobic digester effluent, N. oleoabundans assimilated 90–95% of the initial nitrate and ammonium after 6 d and yielded 10–30% fatty acid methyl esters on a dry weight basis. Cellular lipid content and the N concentration in the growth media were inversely correlated. In addition, the proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acids (i.e. C16:3, C18:2, and C18:3) decreased with N concentration over time while the proportion of C18:1 fatty acid increased. Although N deficiency is likely the primary driver behind lipid accumulation, the influence of culture pH confounded results and requires further study. Other living microorganisms in the digester effluent were not observed to affect algal growth and lipid productivity, though the breakdown of organic nitrogen may have hindered lipid accumulation traditionally achieved through the manipulation of synthetic media. This work highlights the potential for waste-grown mono-algal cultures to produce high quality biodiesel while accomplishing simultaneous wastewater treatment.
1	Abstract   This study is focused on the use of biodiesel in a liquid fuel heating boiler of 26.7 kW. The influence of biodiesel/diesel mixtures, air flow rate, and input pressure on a combustion process for heating purposes was analyzed. The study is divided into two parts. The first one deals with the characteristics of biodiesel as a heating fuel and the analysis of its properties and preparation method. The biodiesel was produced from sunflower oil in a pilot plant of 250 L/charge and was characterized according to standard norms. It was found that biodiesel is not acceptable as fuel for internal combustion engines (ester content of 92%). The second one deals with the effect of the operating variables on the combustion parameters in the boiler. The tests were conducted on experimental facilities and the generated emissions were analyzed. It was found that increasing the input burner pressure involves a decrease in CO and O2 and an increase of CO2 in the fumes, as well as an increase in the combustion process yield. Likewise, a greater air flow rate gives rise to a decrease in the latter parameter. Moreover, CO emissions were slightly higher when biodiesel content was increased in the mixture, and therefore the combustion yield decreased.
1	The aim of this investigation is the development and implementation of a general and systematic procedure for the evaluation of the economic viability of planned installations of wind energy converters (WEC) for the purpose of electrical power production. The procedure is based on: the assessment of wind energy potential of an area (of interest); the limitations involved in selecting specific locations/sites for system installation in this area; the technical specification of a candidate WEC system; and the assessment of the economic viability of such electrical power production systems by applying suitable economic/financial analysis techniques. The proposed procedure was illustrated by applying it in the Thrace area of Greece, taking into consideration the national legislative frame for the exploitation of wind energy resources, and the associated subsidy provided for developing private enterprises with respect to the purchase and installation of the relevant technical equipment. The obtained computational results favor by comparison the installation of medium size WECs (150–500 kW) for the case of independent producers over the case of auto-producers.
1	Pumped storage is generally viewed as the most promising technology to increase renewable energy source (RES) penetration levels in power systems and particularly in small autonomous island grids. Combined wind and pumped-storage “virtual power plants”, called hybrid power stations (HPS), constitute a realistic and feasible option to achieve high penetrations, provided that their components are properly sized. In this paper, the optimum sizing is investigated for a pumped storage HPS operating in an island system. The analysis addresses the sizing of the main HPS components (hydro turbines, pumps, wind farm, reservoirs), adopting either the investor’s perspective, where the objective is to maximize the return on the HPS investment, or a system perspective, where the optimization target is the maximization of RES penetration, along with maintaining the lowest possible generation cost in the system. Genetic Algorithms (GAs) are applied for the optimization and a real isolated island power system is used as a study case. The adopted operating policy and pricing principles, which critically affect the optimal sizing of an HPS project, are based on the existing regulatory framework for storage stations in Greek islands.
1	Pressure control is a fundamental component of safe operation of water supply systems, mainly to reduce leakage, risk of disruption, and maintenance costs. System topology and topography can define high-pressure zones, and the use of Pressure Reducing Valves (PRVs) to maintain standard pressures in these zones is common. However, all energy available in the fluid is dissipated trough headloss. A turbine could be used instead of PRVs to produce electrical energy and to control pressure. The use of Pumps as Turbines (PATs) is recommended to reduce investment cost. Due to dynamic operations throughout the day, PATs operate under varying conditions of flow and head. This variation affects efficiency and headloss, which makes difficult the selection of PATs to substitute PRVs through conventional methods; therefore, this paper proposes a method for such selection. The method is based on maximization of energy produced, restricted to the system pressure limits. To solve this selection problem, the optimization technique of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is used, and complete pump curves are used to simulate the PATs. In addition, this method is capable of identifying the best location on the network to install the PATs.
1	Abstract   Brewery spent grains (BSG), one of the by-products of brewery production, were used for Escherichia coli growth and hydrogen (H2) production. The dilute acid and alkali pretreatment methods were used to hydrolyze the rough lignocellulose structure, and optimal conditions for the BSG hydrolysate (BSGH) preparation were developed. E. coli BW25113 wild type strain and hydrogenase (Hyd)-negative mutants with deletions of genes encoding key subunits of Hyd 1–4 (ΔhyaB, ΔhybC, ΔhycE, ΔhyfG), as well as for a ΔhyaB ΔhybC double mutant were investigated with regards to growth, acidification of the medium, redox potential kinetics and H2 production when using BSGH. Readings of redox Pt electrode dropped to −400 ± 10 mV, with H2 yield of ∼0.75 mmol H2 L−1 at the 3rd h wild type strain growth. Changes in redox Ti-Si electrode readings were negligible. H2 production was not observed with defective Hyd-3 and Hyd-4; therefore, Hyd-3 and Hyd-4 are responsible for H2 production using BSGH, whereas defective Hyd-1 and Hyd-2 led to a ∼2-fold stimulation of H2 yield. The data were confirmed by determining cumulative H2 yield. These findings are useful for development of renewable energy, especially H2 production biotechnology, using different organic wastes as sustainable energy feedstocks.
1	Previous research has shown that afforestation of agricultural land is a relatively low-cost option compared to energy-based approaches for mitigating net carbon dioxide emissions, and that financial incentives affect landowner behavior and can be used to increase carbon sequestration on private land. In this paper we use stated preference data from private landowners in the Pacific Northwest region of the U.S. to examine the key factors affecting participation in an incentive program for carbon sequestration through afforestation. We also estimate the corresponding potential for carbon sequestration and its cost. Our results suggest that incentive payments would significantly and positively affect landowners’ level of enrollment in a tree planting program.
1	Increasing demand for fossil fuels due to the luxurious lifestyle, significant growth of population, transportation and the basic industry sectors has caused serious environmental problems. Moreover, a rapid decline in the fossil fuels has led scientists and researchers to look for new alternatives. In this regard, alternative fuels such as biofuels are becoming important increasingly due to environmental and energy concerns. Biofuels are commonly referred to as first generations, which are produced primarily from food crops. However, the use of edible oil to produce biodiesel in many countries is not feasible in view of a big gap in the demand and supply of such oils for dietary consumption.
1	In October 2014, the European Council agreed on a target of improving overall energy efficiency by at least 27 per cent by 2030. According to the European Council’s conclusions, this target should not be translated into nationally binding targets. Nevertheless individual Member States are free to set higher national objectives if desired. However, it is difficult to assess the degree of ambition of a national target because so far not much light has been shed upon the exact size of the untapped efficiency potentials.
1	Abstract   This article presents an analysis on irradiance modelling and its impact on energy estimation uncertainty. In particular, the calculation of the effective in-plane irradiance from broadband horizontal irradiance is assessed. Thirty-one models for irradiance distribution, decomposition, transposition and spectral correction have been considered. The simulation results have been compared with experimental records obtained during up to three years in 19 locations of the Mediterranean belt with static and tracking systems. Models performance has been evaluated in terms of hourly to yearly weighted errors and frequency distribution similarity. Finally, some best-performing model combinations have been selected.
0	Abstract   Induced stress changes due to CO 2  injection into geological reservoirs can mechanically damage bounding fault- and top seals creating preferential pathways for CO 2  migration from the containment or trigger existing faults causing seismic activity at storage sites. In this paper we present geomechanical simulations of the poro-mechanical effects, thermal and chemical effects of CO 2  injection on the integrity of fault- and top seals. Simulation work was performed as part of recent feasibility studies for geological CO 2  storage in a depleted gas field and a saline aquifer in the Netherlands. Poro-mechanical and thermal effects were investigated using site-specific finite element and finite difference models as well as (semi-)analytical methods. Long term chemical effects were investigated using generic discrete element models of a representative anhydrite caprock sample. The analysis show that (1) geomechanical numerical models can be used to define clear criteria for maximum admissible pressure build-up during CO 2  injection to prevent caprock fracturing, shearing of pre-existing fractures and fault reactivation, (2) combined poro-elastic and thermal effects of CO 2  injection may induce fracturing in the near-well area, (3) long term chemical reactions of anhydrite caprock with CO 2 -rich fluids may cause significant reduction in failure strength at timescales of ∼50000 years.
0	Abstract   The successful commercial scale deployment of carbon capture and storage (CCS) requires assurance of the confinement of the injected CO 2  at each potential storage site. The critical elements of the confinement of CO 2  are the caprock overlying the storage formation, and any faults or fractures which occur within the caprock. The most significant aspect of containment is the seal potential of the caprock, defined as the seal capacity, seal geometry and seal integrity. The seal capacity refers to the CO 2  column height that the caprock can retain before capillary forces allow the migration of the CO 2  into and possibly through the caprock. Determination of capacity is achieved primarily through petrophysical analyses such as mercury injection capillary pressure (MICP) tests. For storage in depleted fields, assessments of seal capacity can be made from empirical observations of actual hydrocarbon column heights and converting these to CO 2  physical properties (density, temperature, pressure). Where these data sources are unavailable, the use of analogs can be a viable alternative. Seal geometry refers to the thickness and lateral extent of the caprock. The caprock must have sufficient lateral extent to cover whatever structural, stratigraphic or hydrodynamic storage reservoir in which the CO 2  is trapped. In addition, its thickness should exceed the throw of any faults that cut so as to maintain an effective barrier despite faults through it. Seal geometry is evaluated through well data (stratigraphic, sedimentological and wireline log analyses) and seismic surveys, which are pre-requisites to any viable storage project. Seal integrity refers to the geomechanical properties of the caprock. These properties are controlled by caprock mineralogy, regional and local stress fields as well as any stress changes induced by injection or withdrawal of water or CO 2 . The modification of the stress field within a storage formation during and after injection of CO 2  can lead to reservoir and caprock mechanical failure. This failure can result in the generation of new faults and fractures, reactivation of existing faults and/or bedding parallel slip. The key parameters determining whether faults might act as conduits or as seals are the juxtaposition relationships of rocks on either side of a fault plane, the properties of the fault zone itself or the reactivation potential of the fault. The greatest likelihood of fluid migration up faults is during or immediately after reactivation. Thus, the mere existence of faults does not automatically rule out a site for geological storage of carbon dioxide. On the contrary, sealing faults commonly trap hydrocarbons and compartmentalize oil and gas reservoirs and could also form suitable confining barriers at CO 2  storage sites. Seal capacity, geometry and integrity interpretations must be tempered by the potential geochemical reactions between fluids and rocks and injected CO 2  as well as by the hydrodynamic environment above and below the seal which may modify the calculated pressure regimes.
1	Abstract   This paper aims to improve the already existing literature data on air concentrations of polychlorinated dibenzo- p -dioxin and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs). Four monitoring campaigns were carried out between 2002 and 2010 near Trento, a town in the North of Italy. These campaigns showed relatively low PCDD/F concentrations, in line with the values found in other Italian urban and industrial sites. Typical values for agricultural regions were measured in rural areas, with an increase during winter, possibly due to biomass burning. No critical situations were detected along an important highway, in spite of the non-negligible emission factors for traffic reported in the literature.
0	When capturing CO2, the collected gas mixture can vary considerably both qualitatively and quantitatively, based on the CO2 origin, the capture process and the industrial sector. Co-injected with CO2, these impurities might be an issue in case of leakage but may also impact the subsurface storage. Operators of the whole CCS chain are therefore waiting for recommendations in terms of admissible concentrations while regulators are waiting for tools allowing them to formulate these recommendations. The SIGARRR project aims at proposing accurate reactive-transport simulations to model the long-term behavior of CO2 and its coinjected gases within storage sites focusing on the reactivity with reservoirs and the possible inferences on the environment. The paper presents first numerical results on water-gas equilibriums in agreement with experiments.

The aim is to achieve thicknesses in the range of100 μm and below while avoiding further kerf loss. The approach using porous silicon as a sacrificial detachment layer and as a seed layer for epitaxial growth can accomplish that goal [1]. Several research groups have already shown the high potential of this technique[2]. Most processes have been conducted in microelectronic-grade batch or single-wafer reactors, questioning the industrial feasibility of this concept. In this work n-type silicon wafers, epitaxially grown in a quasi-inline Atmospheric Pressure Chemical Vapour Deposition (APCVD) reactor, will be presented. The wafers were characterized using confocal white light microscopy, quasi steady state photo conductance decay (QSSPC), microwave detected photo conductance decay (MWPCD) and spreading resistance profiling (SRP) measurements. The first batch of n-type wafers showed mean effective carrier lifetimes exceeding 100 μs on 45 x 45 mm 2  and locally more than 300 μs. A detailed analysis on the thickness distribution, bulk lifetime and surface recombination velocity, affecting the effective carrier lifetime was conducted. For the second batch of n-type wafers mean effective carrier lifetimes of over 260 μs on 25 x25 mm 2  and locally over 500 μs were determined. This corresponds to a local bulk lifetime of over 800 μs and shows the high material quality of epitaxial layers grown in our developed APCVD reactors.
0	Abstract   Organic Rankine cycle (ORC) is one of the most technically feasible methods to convert low-grade thermal energy to electricity. Using zeotropic mixtures as working fluid can provide better temperature matches with the heat source and heat sink, so it is regarded as an efficient approach to improve ORC thermodynamic performance. This paper comparatively investigates the performance of low temperature ORC with pure fluids and zeotropic mixtures. We develop a numerical model considering the size of the heat exchangers to predict both the first law thermal efficiency and cost-effective performance. The results indicate that using mixtures does not gain beneficial effect when the prediction program is improved by taking heat transfer model into account.
1	Abstract   With increasing consideration on public health, the cleaning industry for central air-conditioning systems has been flourished in China with the rapidly developed of both duct-cleaning technology and cleaning robots. By testing the performance on the experimental platform, this paper presents the cleaning effect and motion performance of the duct-cleaning robot designed by our expert group. The result indicates that the cleaning effect is not satisfied at corners and elbows, where the pollution is relatively serious. At the end of this paper, it points out the development direction for China's duct-cleaning robot and its experimental platform, which can provide an important basis to standardize the test platform, tools and methods for the evaluation of robot's performance.
0	Abstract   As High-Z materials will likely be used as plasma-facing components (PFCs) in future fusion devices, the erosion of high-Z materials is a key issue for high-power, long pulse operation. High-Z material erosion and redeposition have been studied using tungsten and molybdenum coated samples exposed in well-diagnosed DIII-D divertor plasma discharges. By coupling dedicated experiments and modelling using the 3D Monte Carlo code ERO, the roles of sheath potential and background carbon impurities in determining high-Z material erosion are identified. Different methods suggested by modelling have been investigated to control high-Z material erosion in DIII-D experiments. The erosion of Mo and W is found to be strongly suppressed by local injection of methane and deuterium gases. The  13 C deposition resulting from local  13 CH 4  injection also provides information on radial transport due to  E  ×  B  drifts and cross field diffusion. Finally, D 2  gas puffing is found to cause local plasma perturbation, suppressing W erosion because of the lower effective sputtering yield of W at lower plasma temperature and for higher carbon concentration in the mixed surface layer.
0	The local coordination environment around Ni(II) in a series of sodium trisilicate (NS3) and albitic (ALB) glasses has been evaluated by using high-resolution XANES and anharmonic EXAFS spectroscopies. The glasses contain ;1000 to 4000 ppm of Ni and from 0 to 8.2 wt.% water. They were synthesized at pressures between 2.2 and 5 kbars and temperatures between 1050 and 1350 K. The bulk glasses were characterized by using X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, Raman, and ultraviolet-Vis-NIR spectroscopies. Both hydrous NS3 and ALB glasses show dominant amounts of Ni(II) in relatively regular 6-coordinated environments, in contrast with their anhydrous counterparts, where 5-coordinated Ni dominates. There are also significant differences in the average medium-range environment (2-3.5 A) around Ni between the anhydrous and hydrous glasses. In the ALB glasses, the presence of water in amounts .2 wt.% induces the formation of nanocrystallites, with an average diameter of ;40 A and an atomic arrangement similar to that of nepouite ( (6) Ni3Si2O5(OH)4) or Ni-talc ( (6) Ni3Si4O10(OH)2) or a related hydrous Ni-silicate. The presence of Ni- bearing nanocrystallites is thought to be due to the relatively slow quench rate of the high-temperature- high- pressure synthesis apparatus used. These nanophases are difficult to detect by using conventional character- ization methods and can cause misleading interpretations of the glass structure if not detected. In contrast, there is no evidence for Ni-rich, nanocrystalline domains in NS3 glasses containing high water contents (up to 8.2 wt.%); instead, two to three Si second neighbors are observed around Ni in all NS3 glasses (and in ALB glasses with water contents ,4 wt.%). The bonding of Ni to oxygens in the tetrahedral framework is inconsistent with the presence of large amounts of Ni(H2O)61 complexes in these glasses. However, Ni(II) may form Ni(OH)n O62n (41n)2 (n ; 6) complexes in hydrous glasses. Our results for Ni combined with results from other studies of 3-d divalent transition metal cations in hydrous silicate glasses suggest that water in silicate melts helps these cations form their preferred coordi- nation environments (6-coordinated for Mn(II), Fe(II), and Ni(II)). Ni(II) may occur in natural hydrous silicate melts dominantly in 6-coordinated environments, rather than dominantly in 4-coordinated environments, as in anhydrous melts and supercritical aqueous fluids, explaining the compatible behavior of Ni in magmas. However, in situ experiments are required to test this suggestion. Copyright © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd
0	Abstract   The hydroxy acid suites extracted from the Murchison (MN), GRA 95229 (GRA) and LAP 02342 (LAP) meteorites have been investigated for their molecular, chiral and isotopic composition. Substantial amounts of the compounds have been detected in all three meteorites, with a total abundance that is lower than that of the amino acids in the same stones. Overall, their molecular distributions mirror closely that of the corresponding amino acids and most evidently so for the LAP meteorite. A surprising  l -lactic acid enantiomeric excess was found present in all three stones, which cannot be easily accounted by terrestrial contamination; all other compounds of the three hydroxy acid suites were found racemic. The branched-chain five carbon and the diastereomer six-carbon hydroxy acids were also studied vis-a-vis the corresponding amino acids and calculated ab initio thermodynamic data, with the comparison allowing the suggestion that meteoritic hydroxyacid at these chain lengths formed under thermodynamic control and, possibly, at a later stage than the corresponding amino acids. 13C and D isotopic enrichments were detected for many of the meteoritic hydroxy acids and found to vary between molecular species with trends that also appear to correlate to those of amino acids; the highest δD value (+3450‰) was displayed by GRA 2-OH-2-methylbutyric acid. The data suggest that, while the amino- and hydroxy acids likely relate to common presolar precursor, their final distribution in meteorites was determined to large extent by the overall composition of the environments that saw their formation, with ammonia being the determining factor in their final abundance ratios.
0	Abstract   We have performed a series of molecular dynamics simulations aimed at the evaluation of the solubility of CO2 in silicate melts of natural composition (from felsic to ultramafic). In making in contact within the simulation cell a supercritical CO2 phase with a silicate melt of a given composition, we have been able to evaluate (i) the solubility of CO2 in the P–T range 1473–2273 K and 20–150 kbar, (ii) the density change experienced by the CO2-bearing melt, (iii) the respective concentrations of CO2 and       CO    3        2  -       species in the melt, (iv) the lifetime and the diffusivity of these species and (v) the structure of the melt around the carbonate groups. The main results are the following:  (1) The solubility of CO2 increases markedly with the pressure in the three investigated melts (a rhyolite, a mid-ocean ridge basalt and a kimberlite) from about ∼2 wt% CO2 at 20 kbar to ∼25 wt% at 100 kbar and 2273 K. The solubility is found to be weakly dependent on the melt composition (as far as the present compositions are concerned) and it is only at very high pressure (above ∼100 kbar) that a clear hierarchy between solubilities occurs (rhyolite   (2) In CO2-saturated melts, the proportion of carbonate ions     (    CO    3        2  -    )     is positively correlated with the pressure at isothermal condition and is negatively correlated with the temperature at isobaric condition (and vice versa for molecular CO2). Furthermore, at fixed (P, T) conditions the proportion of carbonate ions is higher in CO2-undersaturated melts than in the CO2-saturated melt. Although the proportion of molecular CO2 decreases when the degree of depolymerization of the melt increases, it is still significant in CO2-saturated basic and ultrabasic compositions at high temperatures. This finding is at variance with experimental data on CO2-bearing glasses which show no evidence of molecular CO2 as soon as the degree of depolymerization of the melt is high (e.g. basalt). These conflicting results can be reconciled with each other by noticing that a simple low temperature extrapolation of the simulation data predicts that the proportion of molecular CO2 in basaltic melts might be negligible in the glass at room temperature.  (3) The carbonate ions are found to be transient species in the liquid phase, with a lifetime increasing exponentially with the inverse of the temperature. Contrarily to a usual assumption, the diffusivity of carbonate ions into the liquid silicate is not vanishingly small with respect to that of CO2 molecules: in MORB they differ from each other by a factor of ∼6 at 1473 K and only a factor of ∼2 at 2273 K. Although the bulk diffusivity of CO2 is governed primarily by the diffusivity of CO2 molecules, the carbonate ions contribute significantly to the diffusivity of CO2 in depolymerized melts.  (4) Concerning the structure of the CO2-bearing silicate melt, the carbonate ions are found to be preferentially associated with NBO’s of the melt, with an affinity for NBOs which exceeds that for BOs by almost one order of magnitude. This result explains why the concentration in carbonate ions is positively correlated with the degree of depolymerization of the melt and diminishes drastically in fully polymerized melts where the number of NBO’s is close to zero. Furthermore, the network modifier cations are not randomly distributed in the close vicinity of carbonate groups but exhibit a preferential ordering which depends at once on the nature of the cation and on the melt composition. However at the high temperatures investigated here, there is no evidence of long lived complexes between carbonate groups and metal cations.
0	Abstract   Polymerizations of organic monomers including amino acids, nucleotides and monosaccharides are essential processes for chemical evolution of life. Since these reactions proceed with “dehydration” reactions, they are possibly promoted if combined with thermodynamically favorable “hydration” reactions of minerals and salts. To test the possibility, we conducted heating experiments of the simplest amino acid “glycine (Gly)” mixed with four simple anhydrous salts (MgSO4, SrCl2, BaCl2 and Li2SO4) at 140 °C up to 20 days. Gly polymerization was strongly promoted by mixing with the salts in the order of MgSO4 &gt; SrCl2 &gt; BaCl2 &gt; Li2SO4. Up to 6-mer of Gly polymers were synthesized in the Gly–MgSO4 mixture, and a total yield of Gly polymers attained about 7% of the initial amount of Gly by the 20 days heating. The total yield was about 200 times larger than that from the heating of Gly alone. XRD measurements of the Gly–MgSO4 mixture revealed the generation of MgSO4 monohydrate during Gly polymerization. These observations indicate that Gly polymerization was promoted by the salt hydrations through the hydration–dehydration interactions. Based on the observations, we tried to find a relationship between thermodynamic characteristics of the interactions and the promotion effects of each salt on Gly polymerization. It was found that the salts having lower hydration ΔrG0 (easier to hydrate) promote Gly polymerization more strongly. The relationship was used to estimate promotion effects of simple oxide minerals on Gly polymerization. The estimations were consistent with previous observations about the effects of these minerals on Gly polymerization. The fact suggests that the hydration–dehydration interactions between amino acids and minerals are an important mechanism for amino acids’ polymerizations on minerals.
1	Abstract  The PowerPlex ®  ESI 16 Fast, ESI 17 Fast, ESX 16 Fast, and ESX 17 Fast Systems represent faster cycling versions (50min or less) of the PowerPlex ®  ESI and ESX Systems released by Promega in 2009 to accommodate the ENFSI and EDNAP groups' call for new STR multiplexes for Europe. In addition to amplification of purified DNA samples, these new faster cycling systems allow for direct amplification from single-source blood and buccal samples deposited on FTA ®  and nonFTA paper as well as from SwabSolution™ extracts of buccal swabs without the need for purification and quantitation. There are no changes to the autosomal primer pair sequences in the PowerPlex ®  ESI Fast and ESX Fast Systems compared to the original multiplexes, and full concordance at all autosomal loci and amelogenin was observed with data generated previously with the original PowerPlex ®  ESI and ESX Systems. This paper describes the developmental validation study performed on these new fast systems following guidelines issued by the Scientific Working Group on DNA Analysis Methods (SWGDAM) and those of the DNA Advisory Board (DAB). Validation data demonstrate that these systems are sensitive for detecting low levels of DNA while also being capable of generating robust profiles from the high amount of input DNA present in direct-amplification samples. These systems are also tolerant to both high concentrations of PCR inhibitors as well as to slight variations in the final concentration of master mix and primer pair present in the amplification reaction that might be encountered due to pipetting error. The results of this validation study demonstrate that these systems may be used on multiple thermal cyclers and capillary electrophoresis platforms.
1	Abstract   The territory of Chile is particularly long and narrow, which combined with its mountainous terrain, makes it a unique scenario for human genetic studies. We obtained 995 control region mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences from Chileans representing populations living at different latitudes of the country from the North to the southernmost region. The majority of the mtDNA profiles are of Native American origin (∼88%). The remaining haplotypes are mostly of recent European origin (∼11%), and only a minor proportion is of recent African ancestry (∼1%). While these proportions are relatively uniform across the country, more structured patterns of diversity emerge when examining the variation from a phylogeographic perspective. For instance, haplogroup A2 reaches ∼9% in the North, and its frequency decreases gradually to ∼1% in the southernmost populations, while the frequency of haplogroup D (sub-haplogroups D1 and D4) follows the opposite pattern: 36% in the southernmost region, gradually decreasing to 21% in the North. Furthermore, there are remarkable signatures of founder effects in specific sub-clades of Native American (e.g. haplogroups D1j and D4p) and European (e.g. haplogroups T2b3 and K1a4a1a + 195) ancestry. We conclude that the magnitude of the latitudinal differences observed in the patterns of mtDNA variation might be relevant in forensic casework.
1	Abstract   This paper provides an overview of the objectives, methods, and difficulties of regulating quality in electricity distribution networks. Stricter price regulation is associated with a risk of quality degradation and thus a need for quality regulation. But information problems hinder the development of effective quality regulation schemes. This suggests that at some point the benefits of stricter price regulation will not outweigh the additional regulatory costs of setting in place adequate quality regulation.
0	Abstract   A large value of the Curie constant and field dependence of magnetization of C 60 Fe sample point to the existence of superparamagnetic interaction in the compound. The observed nonequilibrium effects can be interpreted within the framework of the superparamagnetic blocking model, if one assumes that the solid consists of clusters (composed of many C 60 Fe complexes) that have large magnetic moments. A wide temperature range of irreversible magnetization of the C 60 Fe samples and a broad maximum of the susceptibility temperature dependence suggest the distribution of the cluster size. Semiempirical quantum chemical calculations show that C 60 Fe complexes might adopt high spin state.
0	The use of antiferromagnetic (AF) materials to pin a soft ferromagnet (FM) in a spin-valve, read head, or MRAM cell, has focussed attention on the exchange bias phenomenon. We report on a study of the thermal stability of exchange bias systems, IrMn/CoFe and FeMn/NiFe, with different thicknesses and grain sizes. For these materials a temperature has been determined at which thermal activation does not affect the state of the antiferromagnet, leading to reproducible data. Grain size studies have shown that the coercivity and exchange bias have different origins. Training effects studied over a range of temperatures from 4.2 to 400 K indicate a range of different contributions to exchange bias from the magnetic state of the antiferromagnet.
0	Abstract   The paper reports a feasibility study of new type bit-patterned-media using a nano-patterned glassy alloy template for ultra-high density hard disk applications. The prototype bit-patterned-media was prepared using a nano-hole array pattern fabricated on a Pd-based glassy alloy thin film and a Co/Pd multilayered film filled in the nano-holes. The prepared prototype bit-patterned-media had a smooth surface and isolated Co/Pd multilayer magnetic dots, where the average dot diameter, the average dot pitch and the average dot height were 30, 60 and 19 nm, respectively. MFM (magnetic force microscope) observation revealed that each dot was magnetized in a perpendicular direction and the magnetization could reverse when an opposite magnetic field was applied. Static read/write tester measurements showed that repeated writing and reading on isolated magnetic dots were possible in combination with conventional magnetic heads and high-accuracy positioning technologies. The present study indicates that the new type of bit-patterned-media composed of nano-hole arrays fabricated on glassy alloy film template and Co/Pd multilayer magnetic dots are promising for applications to next generation ultra-high density hard disk drives.
0	Abstract   FeNi L10 (tetrataenite) phase has great perspectives for hard magnetic materials production. In this paper we report on synthesis of this phase in chemically co-precipitated FeNi nanopowder by means of a thermal treatment procedure which includes cycling oxidation and reduction processes at 320 °C. The presence of the FeNi L10 phase in the samples was confirmed by magnetic measurements and differential scanning calorimetry analysis.
1	Abstract   SACH systems, as a type of renewable energy systems, meet building cooling and heating demand through solar energy and therefore can reduce energy consumption and, in turn, mitigate the environmental impacts associated with building operation. Many researchers have evaluated and optimized the design of SACH systems under deterministic schemes; however, deterministic approach is subject to uncertain parameters in the evaluation or objective functions such as energy prices in the future and the results subsequently may not hold true. To enhance the design robustness and validate the use of deterministic approaches, a stochastic multi-objective optimization (SMOO) model is developed that incorporates these uncertainties. In this paper, a SACH system is optimized with respects to life-cycle energy, economic, and environment performance. The uncertain parameters considered include the life span of SACH systems and the fluctuations of energy markets and financial conditions. A case study follows to investigate the relationship among uncertainty and different designs. The comparison between deterministic and stochastic optimization shows that deterministic optimization can be used by designers who are moderate or not risk-averse at all.
1	Abstract   We present a detailed statistical analysis of the blocks appearing in the binary expansions of the Feigenbaum constants    α    and    δ    for the logistic map. Significant deviations from randomness are revealed, suggesting that these constants correspond to non-normal binary numbers. Applying a widely believed conjecture, it is concluded that the transcendental character of the constants can be seriously envisaged, within the limits of the statistical precision corresponding to the number of digits available.
1	Abstract   The generalized diffusion equations, with nonlinear source terms which encompasses the Fisher, Newell–Whitehead, FitzHugh–Nagumo and Allen–Cahn equations as particular forms are solved by the G′/G-expansion method. The exact solutions are in terms of hyperbolic, trigonometric and rational functions with external parameters. This paper concludes with the stationary topological soliton solution of the FitzHugh–Nagumo equation that is obtained by the Ansatz method.
1	Abstract   In this paper, the problem of active fault tolerant control (FTC) is studied for a class of flexible spacecraft attitude systems with Lipschitz nonlinearity and sensor fault. Firstly, a functional observer is designed for the attitude systems of flexible spacecraft in order to detect the time of unknown sensor fault occurred. Next, the sensor fault estimation is performed by filtering the output estimation error, as usually done in the residual generation framework. Then, a dynamic output feedback-based FTC approach is proposed to the flexible spacecraft in sensor faulty case, it not only attenuates flexible appendage disturbance with a given level γ, but also tolerates the effect of unknown sensor fault. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed FTC method is demonstrated in the attitude systems of flexible spacecraft subject to a time-varying sensor fault.
1	Advances in metabolic engineering have enabled bioprocess optimization at the genetic level. Large-scale systematic models are now available at a genome level for many biological processes. There is, thus, a motivation to develop advanced control algorithms, using these complex models, to identify optimal performance strategies both at the genetic and bioreactor level. In the present paper, the bilevel optimization framework previously developed by the authors is coupled with control algorithms to determine the genetic manipulation strategies in practical bioprocess applications. The bilevel optimization includes a linear programming problem in the inner level and a nonlinear optimization problem in the outer level. Both gradient-based and stochastic methods are used to solve the nonlinear optimization problem. Ethanol production in an anaerobic batch fermentation of Escherichia coli is considered in case studies that demonstrate optimization of ethanol production, batch time, and multi-batch scheduling.
1	Abstract   Recent interpretations of upper continental mantle seismic anisotropy observations have often relied on fabric measurements and calculated anisotropies of upper mantle xenoliths. Seismic ray paths of P and S waves, which provide information on azimuthal compressional wave anisotropy and shear wave splitting, are tens to hundreds of kilometers, whereas, xenoliths are usually only a few centimeters in diameter. To place better constraints on field-based anisotropy observations and to evaluate anisotropy information provided by xenoliths, it is important to examine anisotropy in large ultramafic massifs which have originated in the upper mantle. One such massif is the Twin Sisters Range located in the western portion of the North Cascades of Washington State, USA. The Twin Sisters massif, a slab of unaltered dunite, is 16 km in length, 6 km in width and 3 km thick. Exposed along its south and west sides are mafic granulite facies rocks, which likely represent lower continental crustal fragments. The ultramafic rocks are porphyroclastic in texture, consisting of strained, flattened porphyroclasts of olivine and enstatite and strain-free olivine mosaics. Olivine fabrics are typical of those formed at high temperatures and low strain rates. Petrofabrics and calculated anisotropies of individual samples vary throughout the massif, however, overall anisotropy of the body is significant, with maximum P and S waves anisotropies of 5.4% and 3.9%, respectively. The maximum delay time for split shear waves traveling through a 100-km-thick slab is 0.8 s and two directions of shear wave singularity are observed. The directions of maximum shear wave splitting and shear wave singularities do not coincide with the directions of maximum and minimum compressional wave velocity. In general, individual hand samples show significantly higher anisotropy than the overall anisotropy of the massif. It is concluded that simple averages of xenolith anisotropies are unreliable for use in the interpretation of field anisotropy observations.
1	For characterizing geothermal systems, it is important to have clear images of steeply-dipping fault zones because they may confine the boundaries of geothermal reservoirs and influence hydrothermal flow. Elastic reverse-time migration (ERTM) is the most promising tool for subsurface imaging with multicomponent seismic data. However, conventional ERTM usually generates significant artifacts caused by the cross correlation of undesired wavefields and the polarity reversal of shear waves. In addition, it is difficult for conventional ERTM to directly image steeply-dipping fault zones. We develop a new ERTM imaging method in this paper to reduce these artifacts and directly image steeply-dipping fault zones. In our new ERTM method, forward-propagated source wavefields and backward-propagated receiver wavefields are decomposed into compressional (P) and shear (S) components. Each component of these wavefields is separated into left- and right-going, or downgoing and upgoing waves. The cross correlation imaging condition is applied to the separated wavefields along opposite propagation directions. For converted waves (P-to-S or S-to-P), the polarity correction is applied to the separated wavefields based on the analysis of Poynting vectors. Numerical imaging examples of synthetic seismic data demonstrate that our new ERTM method produces high-resolution images of steeply-dipping fault zones.
1	Abstract   To arrest climate change, a transition to a low-carbon economy must take place quite rapidly, within a century at most. Thus, the rate of diffusion of new technologies such as those for the generation of electricity from renewable energy sources becomes a central issue. This article explores the reasons for the particularly rapid spread of two such technologies in Germany, wind turbines and solar cells. We trace this diffusion to the nature of the policy instruments employed and to the political process which led to the adoption of these instruments. The analysis demonstrates how the regulatory framework is formed in a ‘battle over institutions’ where the German parliament, informed and supported by an advocacy coalition of growing strength, backed support policies for renewables sourced electricity against often reluctant governments and the opposition from nuclear and coal interests. It also demonstrates that this major political and environmental achievement carries a modest price if we consider total costs to society, i.e. including both subsidies to coal and the negative external economies of coal.
1	In this paper, a quantitative algorithm for direct and indirect energy savings is developed based on the database analysis of China's energy consumption per GDP in the last two decades. The result shows that direct energy savings due to improved energy conversion and end-use utilization efficiencies only account for 26.5% of the total energy savings, and that indirect energy savings due to increased added value of products, product shifts, and structure shifts in industries account for 73.5% of the total energy savings. Factors affecting indirect energy savings are then analyzed, and total energy system efficiencies and direct energy savings in 2020 are quantitatively estimated, which shows that enlarging indirect energy savings is a more crucial task for China's macro-energy conservation in the future. The paper suggests that China should pay more attention to indirect energy savings to improve the energy utilization output benefits by increasing the added value of products, optimizing product and industry structures, and improving production technologies. The potential of indirect energy savings in China is more significant compared with developed countries.
1	Today coal covers 38% of global production and roughly 30% of the EU-25 power output. In 2005 domestic lignite with a share of 60.5% in power generation and accounting about 30% of primary energy consumption is currently the most important indigenous fuel of Greece. Greece, mining 70Â Mt annually, is the second lignite producer in the EU and fourth in the world. Approximately 97% of the lignite used to supply the existing lignite-fired power plants of Greece is mined by Public Power Corporation S.A. (PPC). Lignite as the base load fuel gives a competitive strength in PPC's and Greece's fuel mix. Due to lignite consumer prices in Greece are significantly below those in other comparable markets in EU-15. Extraction of lignite has a very long tradition. Significant achievements and large experience which has been gained during many years of mining operations place Greek lignite-mining industry in the leading position in Europe. The paper presents current state of Greek lignite industry, including operating mines, volume of production and other important production indicators as well as improvements in labor productivity and good results in industrial safety. The future of coal and specifically of Greek lignite will be crucially determined by environmentally compatible, i.e. low-CO2 generation of electricity. Investment in modernization and renewal of the power plant fleet are the key to securing electricity supply and progress in preventing climate change.
1	Previous studies that have tested for a unit root in aggregate energy consumption have potentially reached misleading conclusions because they fail to allow for the possibility that energy consumption might be fractionally integrated and do not distinguish between different types of energy consumption. This study tests for long memory in disaggregated petroleum consumption in the United States using univariate and multivariate Lagrange multiplier (LM) tests for fractional integration. The results point strongly to the need to distinguish between different forms of energy consumption and allow for a generalization of the I(0)/I(1) dichotomy when considering the order of integration of energy consumption. Allowing for short-run dynamics, the univariate test suggests that less than 50% of the series are fractionally integrated. Consistent with expectations the non-stationary series are found to have the highest mean and standard deviation. The multivariate test suggests that petroleum consumption in the commercial and industrial sectors is clearly fractionally integrated when allowing for short-run dynamics, and, as such, exhibits persistent effects, while petroleum consumption in the residential sector is a stationary process.
1	Demand managers currently draw on a limited range of psychology and economic theories in order to shift and shed peak electricity demand. These theories place individual consumers and their attitudes, behaviours and choices at the centre of the problem. This paper reframes the issue of peak electricity demand using theories of social practices, contending that the ‘problem’ is one of transforming, technologically-mediated social practices. It reflects on how this body of theory repositions and refocuses the roles and practices of professions charged with the responsibility and agency for affecting and managing energy demand. The paper identifies three areas where demand managers could refocus their attention: (i) enabling co-management relationships with consumers; (ii) working beyond their siloed roles with a broader range of human and non-human actors; and (iii) promoting new practice ‘needs’ and expectations. It concludes by critically reflecting on the limited agency attributed to ‘change agents’ such as demand managers in dominant understandings of change. Instead, the paper proposes the need to identify and establish a new group of change agents who are actively but often unwittingly involved in reconfiguring the elements of problematic peaky practices.
0	Most of small islands around the world today, are dependent on imported fossil fuels for the majority of their energy needs especially for transport activities and electricity production. The use of locally renewable energy resources and the implementation of energy efficiency measures could make a significant contribution to their economic development by reducing fossil fuel imports. An electrification of vehicles has been suggested as a way to both reduce pollutant emissions and increase security of supply of the transportation sector by reducing the dependence on oil products imports and facilitate the accommodation of renewable electricity generation, such as wind and, in the case of volcanic islands like Sao Miguel (Azores) of the geothermal energy whose penetration has been limited by the valley electricity consumption level. In this research, three scenarios of EV penetration were studied and it was verified that, for a 15% LD fleet replacement by EVs with 90% of all energy needs occurring during the night, the accommodation of 10MW of new geothermal capacity becomes viable. Under this scenario, reductions of 8% in electricity costs, 14% in energy, 23% in fossil fuels use and CO2 emissions for the transportation and electricity production sectors could be expected.

To protect the receiver's benefit, the receiver can easily convert the signature into an ordinary one that can be verified by anyone. Several feasible attacks will be discussed, and the security analysis will prove that none of them can successfully break the proposed scheme.
1	In this work, an experimental investigation into the effects, in terms of energy, of employing a dedicated mechanical subcooling cycle with a residential 1.5ton simple vapor compression refrigeration system is presented. A comparative analysis of the experimental cycle performance is conducted with and without the dedicated subcooler cycle when the room temperature is kept between 18 and 22°C. This is done in order to ascertain the percentage increase in efficiency due to use of a dedicated subcooling loop. R22 is employed as the refrigerant in the main cycle whereas R12 is flowing in the dedicated subcooling cycle. The experimental outcomes indicate that the load carrying capacity of the evaporator increased by approximately 0.5kW when R22 was subcooled, in the main cycle, by 5–8°C. It was also noted that, by using the subcooling, the second-law efficiency of the cycle increased by an average of 21%. Furthermore, the general trend indicated that this percentage increase is inversely proportional to the ambient temperature variation. The experimental work proves that dedicated subcooling can be used for increasing cooling capacity and efficiency.
1	Techno-economic analysis (TEA) is a well-established modeling process for evaluating the economic feasibility of emerging technologies. Most previous TEA studies focused on creating reliable cost estimates but returned deterministic net present values (NPV) and deterministic breakeven prices which cannot convey the considerable uncertainties embedded in important techno-economic variables. This study employs stochastic techno-economic analysis in which Monte Carlo simulation is incorporated into traditional TEA. The distributions of NPV and breakeven price are obtained. A case of cellulosic biofuel production from fast pyrolysis and hydroprocessing pathway is used to illustrate the method of modeling stochastic TEA and quantifying the breakeven price distribution. The input uncertainties are translated to outputs so that the probability density distribution of both NPV and breakeven price are derived. Two methods, a mathematical method and a programming method, are developed to quantify breakeven price distribution in a way that can consider future price trend and uncertainty. Two scenarios are analyzed, one assuming constant real future output prices, and the other assuming that future prices follow an increasing trend with stochastic disturbances. It is demonstrated that the breakeven price distributions derived using the developed methods are consistent with the corresponding NPV distributions regarding the percentile value and the probability of gain/loss. The results demonstrate how breakeven price distributions communicate risks and uncertainties more effectively than NPV distributions. The stochastic TEA and the methods of creating breakeven price distribution can be applied to evaluating other technologies.

The methods show promise in their ability to detect leak in actual Steam Generator Units from the noise data with very low S/N ratios. Further analysis of data have yielded useful information on the potential of acoustic leak detection system.
0	Abstract   Time evolution of criticality and burnup grades of the PBMR were investigated for reactor grade plutonium and minor actinides in the spent fuel of light water reactors (LWRs) mixed with thoria. The calculations were performed by employing the computer codes MCNP and MONTEBURNS 2.0 and using the ENDF/B-V nuclear data library. Firstly, the plutonium–thorium and minor actinides–thorium ratio was determined by using the initial keff value of the original uranium fuel design. After the selection of the plutonium/minor actinides–thorium mixture ratio, the time-dependent neutronic behavior of the reactor grade plutonium and minor actinides and original fuels in a PBMR-400 reactor was calculated by using the MCNP code. Finally, keff, burnup and operation time values of the fuels were compared. The core effective multiplication factor (keff) for the original fuel which has 9.6 wt.% enriched uranium was computed as 1.2395. Corresponding to this keff value the reactor grade plutonium/thorium and minor actinide/thorium oxide mixtures were found to be 30%/70% and 50%/50%, respectively. The core lives for the original, the reactor grade plutonium/thorium and the minor actinide/thorium fuels were calculated as ∼3.2, ∼6.5 and ∼5.5 years, whereas, the corresponding burnups came out to be 99,000, ∼190,000 and ∼166,000 MWD/T, respectively, for an end of life keff set equal to 1.02.
1	Combustion in Porous Media provides interesting advantages compared with the free flame combustion due to the higher burning rates, increased power dynamic range, the extension of lean flammability limits, and the low emissions of pollutants. A numerical code is developed in order to evaluate the effects of different parameters of combustion in porous media. The governing equations including Navier–Stokes, the solid and gas energy and the chemical species transport equations are solved using a multi-step reduced kinetic mechanism. Flame stabilization and the burner optimization are studied by EGM (Entropy Generation Minimization) method considering the effects of chemical affinities and reaction. It is found that the flames occurring at the upstream half of the porous layer are more stable and more efficient, producing less emissions than those occur at the downstream half of porous layer. Also at a specified equivalence ratio both the heat recirculation efficiency and the Merit number have similar trend by changing the flame location. For a FFL (Fixed Flame Location), there is an optimum value of equivalence ratio at which the burner efficiency is a maximum.
1	In this paper, a new technology for a tangential firing pulverized coal boiler, high efficiency and low NOx combustion technology with multiple air-staged and a large-angle counter flow fuel-rich jet (ACCT for short) is proposed. To verify the characteristics of this technology, experiments of two combustion technologies, ACCT and CFS-1 (Concentric Firing System-1), are carried out under a cold model of a 1025t/h tangential firing boiler with a PDA (particle dynamics anemometer). The distributions of velocity, particle concentration, particle diameters and the particle volume flux of primary air and secondary air are obtained. The results show that the fuel-rich primary air of ACCT can go deeper into the furnace and mix with the main flow better, which means that the counter flow of fuel-rich jets in ACCT can realize stable combustion, low NOx emission and slagging prevention.
1	This paper presents the application of the partial element equivalent circuit (PEEC) method in the time and frequency domains for calculating tower surge responses and insulator voltages of an actual transmission tower, and transient performance of grounding systems. Neglecting of electromagnetic retardation effect in the PEEC method in the time domain is proposed to increase efficiency of the method. Incorporation of nonlinear elements such as a flashover model and a soil ionization model with the PEEC method in the time domain is presented. Moreover, an effective way to increase the efficiency of the method in terms of computation time, which consists of the appropriate combination of the PEEC method and the transmission line theory, is proposed. The transmission line model is adapted to combine with the method for reducing elements in the PEEC method. Comparisons of the simulation results by the proposed methods in the time and frequency domains with other numerical methods and with available experimental data show satisfactory agreement.

1	Opportunities for private investments in renewable energies were explored using a stated-preference investment allocation instrument. Allocation alternatives included conventional and renewable energy investments. Among renewable energy investments, solar and wind energy were ranked the highest while grass and wood-based technologies were at the bottom of the renewable energy list. This ranking mirrors the allocation of investments in sustainable energy technologies in global markets. Results were analyzed using a two-limit tobit model which suggests that certainty of investments, a diversified portfolio and expectation on financial returns were the primary drivers behind funds allocated to renewable energy investments. Using cluster analysis, twenty-three percent of our sample of current and future investors was identified as individuals most willing to invest in renewable energies.
0	This paper estimates the affordability of Chinese companies on energy cost increases due to the introduction of market-based climate policies. The data were collected from 170 respondents mainly from iron and steel, cement and chemical industries, using a multiple-bounded discrete choice (MBDC) format. Estimations indicate that a mean of 8.8% in energy cost increase would be acceptable for all the samples. The chemical companies express a slightly higher affordability, with the mean of acceptable ratios of energy cost increases being 9.9%, while the cement companies show slightly lower affordability with a mean of 7.7%. Econometric analysis confirms that the market competition degree has a significant but negative relationship with the affordability while the company's size is significantly and positively associated with the affordability. Calculations indicate that the mean of affordable energy cost increases roughly equals a carbon price of 83.7 CNY/t-CO2 (about 12 USD/t-CO2) for chemical companies and around 40 CNY/t-CO2 (about 6 USD/t-CO2) for iron and steel and cement sectors. This result provides a meaningful referendum for the development of carbon tax and the establishment of a domestic carbon emissions trading scheme in China, especially from the perspective of surveyed industries.
1	Abstract   Distributed generation (DG) sources are becoming more prominent in distribution systems due to the incremental demands for electrical energy. Locations and capacities of DG sources have profoundly impacted on the system losses in a distribution network. In this paper, a novel combined genetic algorithm (GA)/particle swarm optimization (PSO) is presented for optimal location and sizing of DG on distribution systems. The objective is to minimize network power losses, better voltage regulation and improve the voltage stability within the frame-work of system operation and security constraints in radial distribution systems. A detailed performance analysis is carried out on 33 and 69 bus systems to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.
1	Abstract   This study determines optimum aggregation areas for a given distribution network considering spatial distribution of loads and costs of aggregation. An elitist genetic algorithm combined with a hierarchical clustering and a Thevenin network reduction is implemented to compute strategic locations and aggregate demand within each area. The aggregation reduces large distribution networks having thousands of nodes to an equivalent network with few aggregated loads, thereby significantly reducing the computational burden. Furthermore, it not only helps distribution system operators in making faster operational decisions by understanding during which time of the day will be in need of flexibility, from which specific area, and in which amount, but also enables the flexibilities stemming from small distributed resources to be traded in various power/energy markets. A combination of central and local aggregation scheme where a central aggregator enables market participation, while local aggregators materialize the accepted bids, is implemented to realize this concept. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated by comparing network performances with and without aggregation. For a given network configuration, steady-state performance of aggregated network is significantly accurate (    ≈  ±    1.5% error) compared to very high errors associated with forecast of individual consumer demand.
1	Abstract   As one of the six Generation-IV reactors, SFR (sodium-cooled fast reactor) is attracting more and more attention in recent years. To evaluate the SFR safety characteristics, the Shutdown Heat Removal Tests (SHRT) conducted by Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) were performed in Experimental Breeder Reactor-II (EBR-II) to verify inhere safety characteristics. To find the inaccuracies in the exist models and improve the simulating level for SFR, SHRT-17 and SHRT-45R have been chosen as the benchmark problems for the IAEA coordinated research project (CRP), which we have participated in. THACS (the Transient Thermal-Hydraulic Code for Analysis of Sodium Cooled Fast Reactor) developed by XJTU was used in our work. THACS has finished preliminary with completion of all the models of primary loop originally intended for simulating accidents in SFRs. THACS is a multi-channel, multi-phase, multi-component transient and universal code coupled with the point reactor kinetics model. In this paper the models of THACS were introduced in detail and SHRT scenario simulation work of EBR-II has been performed. THACS was verified with the simulation results of flowrate and temperatures in core and instrumented subassembly XX09. After the verification, the peak coolant, cladding and fuel temperatures were estimated which is under the safety limits. Results show that EBR-II is effective in protecting the reactor against the severe loss-of-flow accidents. The three-layer model for cold pool coupled with THACS was used and the predicted results in a better agreement with the measurements.
1	Abstract   The objective of this paper is to present a method to evaluate the characteristics and performance of a single stage lithium bromide (LiBr)–water absorption machine. The necessary heat and mass transfer equations and appropriate equations describing the properties of the working fluids are specified. These equations are employed in a computer program, and a sensitivity analysis is performed. The difference between the absorber LiBr inlet and outlet percentage ratio, the coefficient of performance of the unit in relation to the generator temperature, the efficiency of the unit in relation to the solution heat exchanger area and the solution strength effectiveness in relation to the absorber solution outlet temperature are examined. Information on designing the heat exchangers of the LiBr–water absorption unit are also presented. Single pass, vertical tube heat exchangers have been used for the absorber and for the evaporator. The solution heat exchanger was designed as a single pass annular heat exchanger. The condenser and the generator were designed using horizontal tube heat exchangers. The calculated theoretical values are compared to experimental results derived for a small unit with a nominal capacity of 1 kW. Finally, a cost analysis for a domestic size absorber cooler is presented.
1	Sustainability is the trend of the modern building designs, in which solar energy conversion systems and daylighting schemes are widely considered as the important building energy strategies to reduce the peak cooling and electrical demands, generate clean energy and save the building electricity expenditures. A semi-transparent photovoltaic (PV) is a renewable energy product producing electricity via solar cells and allowing natural light entering into the interior spaces for daylighting designs. The PV modules are effective in reducing the cooling demand, especially for the skylight atrium that often receives large solar heat gains. This paper studies the thermal and visual properties, energy performance, environmental and financial issues of such semi-transparent PV skylights. Field measurements including solar irradiance, daylight illuminance and electricity generated were carried out. Case studies based on a circulating atrium were conducted to evaluate the energy use, cooling requirements and monetary implications when the PV skylights together with the daylight-linked lighting controls were applied. The results indicated that such an integrated system could save the overall electricity expenditures and benefit to the environmental and financial aspects.
0	Magnetoelastic thin films and multilayers were optimized to exhibit a high inverse magnetostrictive effect and a high ferromagnetic resonance frequency. FeCo/CoB and FeCoBSi films were used in two promising applications, a resonant LC circuit and a transmission line. In both cases the basic structure is a strip line with magnetic sandwich layers, which increase the inductance. In the resonant circuit design, a magnetic field or stress applied to the device changes the permeability of the magnetic layers and therefore the inductance and the resonance frequency of the device. Resonance frequencies of about 500 MHz with quality factors of up to 8 could be achieved. Such LC circuits can be used as remote interrogated stress or torque sensors. The second design is a transmission-line device, which shows a large wavelength shortening effect and can be used as a band filter in GHz applications.

Germanium bridges and membranes have been fabricated by lithography and wet-anisotropic chemical etching from SiGe/Ge heterostructures epitaxially deposited on Si substrates. The goal of this work is to remove completely the Si under the structures without damaging the Si material present in the SiGe alloys by using a suitable etchant. Etching by potassium hydroxide and by tetramethylammonium hydroxide solutions have been optimized in order to etch only the pure silicon underneath the structures. All the fabrication processes, to achieve free-standing structures with different shape and size, have been systematically characterized by scanning electron microscopy and µRaman spectroscopy.
1	Abstract   The implantation of a nuclear facility, such as ITER (about 20 buildings on 40 ha) requires many preparatory studies, particularly with respect to underground characteristics, topography, layout, deforestation, excavations, networks, fences and roads and impact of seismic hazard on design.  This paper presents the main results of these studies, carried out within the European ITER Site Studies Framework. A dedicated paper  [O. Guerin, B. Coururier, A. Maas, Transport, logistics and packaging of ITER components, 23rd SOFT, 2004, Venice, Italy]  in the conference deals with the transport studies.  To choose the site for ITER implantation, detailed geological, hydrogeological and geophysical investigations have been carried out. Taking into account the meteorological data (particularly the main wind direction), topography, access, electrical supply, fluid needs and constraints (gravity systems), buildings and roads have been implemented.
0	Abstract   The fusion-driven subcritical system (named FDS-I) was previously proposed as an intermediate step toward the final application of fusion energy. A conceptual design of the FDS-I is presented, which consists of the fusion neutron driver with relatively easy-achieved plasma parameters, and the He-gas/liquid lithium–lead Dual-cooled subcritical Waste Transmutation (DWT) blanket used to transmute long-lived radioactive wastes and to generate energy on the basis of self-sustainable fission and fusion fuel cycle. An overview of the FDS-I is given and the specifications of the design analysis are summarized.

In 2012 and 2013, the Los Angeles Department of Water &amp; Power and Glendale Water &amp; Power became the first municipally owned utilities to implement decoupling. This article explains why and how each utility implemented decoupling, and describes the impact since.
1	Abstract   Parallel F-actin bundles are a class of organized semiflexible polymers that play a critical role in cell mechanics, including cell adhesion, cell spreading, cell migration, mitosis and intracellular transport. Here we develop an analytical model of hyperelastic behaviors of an F-actin bundle by considering a wormlike chain confined in a harmonic potential. Closed form solutions are obtained for the axial stress—strain relation of an F-actin bundle under stretch.
1	Abstract   Excavations for deep basements in urban areas present complex design questions, e.g. related to the selection of retaining systems and the specification of construction processes. Consideration must be given to the design of structural systems to support the excavation and the mitigation of any impact that the construction might have on any nearby infrastructure. The finite element analysis is routinely used (in design and research) for the analysis of this type of complex soil-structure interaction problem. Care is needed to ensure that representations of the construction processes, soil and structural behaviour are incorporated in the finite element model at an appropriate level of detail. This paper addresses the implementation of construction procedures in a finite element analysis of a deep excavation in Shanghai. Initially, an analysis is developed to model the construction processes actually employed in the project. The results of this model compare favourably with data measured during construction. The model is then developed to investigate the influence of certain aspects of the construction processes on the computed results. The results indicate the following: (i) the construction sequence for the floor slabs does not have a significant influence on the computed deformations in the retaining walls or the nearby ground at the end of construction; (ii) earth beams (used as temporary supports) are effective in reducing the computed wall and ground movements, and (iii) neglecting the presence of openings in the floor slabs may lead to unconservative calculations of the retaining wall and ground movements.
0	Abstract   Nowadaysthe use of new high strength alloys is growing, but these alloys are difficult to machine due to the high temperatures generated during cutting. A solution is the use of cutting fluids, but those have adverse environmental effects, health risks and high costs of purchase, storage and maintenance. An emerging alternative is the use of cryogenic fluids such as liquid nitrogen (LN 2 ). Nevertheless, in order to accept a new machining process industrially, it must be assured that final structural integrity of the machined part is at least as good as that generated by conventional machining processes.Therefore, in this work it has been compared the surface integrity (roughness, hardness, residual stresses and microstructure) generated in AISI 4150 (50CrMo4) steel by dry turning, turning with lubricant (oil based emulsion) and cryogenic turning with LN 2 . The results prove that cryogenic machining is the best solution since it reduces machining problems of heating, leading to tool life improvement and better surface integrity of turned components.
0	Abstract   Transport of the fresh dielectric fluid into the discharge gap as well as debris removal from the hole becomes more difficult and essential in micro-EDM deep hole drilling. To solve this problem horizontal-feeding of electrode in EDM drilling of micro hole had been investigated, but the depth of hole which can be drilled is still very limited. An approach of micro-EDM drilling by inclined feeding of the electrode incorporated with vibration of the electrode in the longitudinal direction is proposed and implemented. It is found that either inclined feeding or axial vibration of the electrode leads to an increase of the depth of the hole being drilled as compared with horizontal-feeding method. A significant improvement is obtained when both are applied simultaneously. The depth of hole is increased by 75% when the aluminum alloy 6061 is drilled by a 200 μm in diameter electrode using a 10-degrees downward electrode feeding together with the axial vibration having the frequency and amplitude of 250 Hz, and 5 μm, respectively. The maximum aspect ratio achievable is 24 in this case. It is 26 for the stainless steel drilled by a 100 μm in diameter electrode, and 18 when the size of electrode is reduced to 50 μm in diameter.
1	Abstract   By using modified simple equation method, we study the generalized RLW equation and symmetric RLW equation, the subsistence of solitary wave, periodic cusp wave, periodic bell wave solutions are obtained. We establish some conditions on the parameters for which the obtained solutions are dark or bright soliton. The proficiency of the methods for constructing exact solutions has been established. Finally, the variety of structure and graphical representation makes the dynamics of the equations visible and provides the mathematical foundation in shallow water, plasma and ion acoustic plasma waves.
1	Modeling and simulation of nonlinear systems under chaotic behavior is presented. Nonlinear systems and their relation to chaos as a result of nonlinear interaction of different elements in the system are presented. Application of chaotic theory for power systems is discussed through simulation results. Simulation of some mathematical equations, e.g. Vander Pol's equation, Lorenz's equation, Duffing's equation and double scroll equations are presented. Theoretical aspects of dynamical systems, the existence of chaos in power system and their dependency on system parameters and initial conditions using computer simulations are discussed. From the results one can easily understand the strange attractor and transient stages to voltage collapse, angle instability or voltage collapse and angle divergence simultaneously. Important simulation results of chaos for a model three bus system are presented and discussed.
1	Abstract   A case study of a catastrophic failure of a web marine crankshaft and a failure analysis under bending and torsion applied to crankshafts are presented. A microscopy (eye seen) observation showed that the crack initiation started on the fillet of the crankpin by rotary bending and the propagation was a combination of cyclic bending and steady torsion. The crack front profile approximately adopts a semi-elliptical shape with some distortion due to torsion and this study is supported by a previous research work already published by the authors. The number of cycles from crack initiation to final failure of this crankshaft was achieved by recording of the main engine operation on board, taking into account the beachmarks left on the fatigue crack surface. The cycles calculated by the linear elastic fracture mechanics approaches showed that the propagation was fast which means that the level of bending stress was relatively high when compared with total cycles of main engine in service. Microstructure defects or inclusion were not observed which can conclude that the failure was probably originated by an external cause and not due to an intrinsic latent defect. Possible effects of added torsional vibrations which induce stresses are also discussed. Some causes are analyzed and reported here but the origin of the fatigue fracture was not clearly determined.
0	Abstract   In spite of the high levels of reliability of modern aeroengine components resulting from rigid standards and practices, failures of compressor and turbine blades during normal operational environments are common situations which compromise the flight safety. The investigation of real failures affecting these components allows gaining a deeper knowledge concerning the mechanisms of crack initiation and propagation which, in turn, can be used in order to prevent future incidents or accidents.  This paper presents the analysis of two in service failures involving blades breakage belonging to different compressor stages. Crack growth mechanisms were evaluated based on the visual inspection of the affected components and with both macroscopic and microscopic observations of the fracture surfaces. The origins of crack initiation were evaluated through the examination of crack path and beach marks on the fracture surface.  Mechanical analyses were carried out to identify the possible causes of the failures by examining anomalies in the mechanical behaviour of the materials such as hardness tests, chemical composition and surface coating analysis through SEM observations.  The analysis of the different fracture surfaces shows that crack propagation is mainly related with fatigue mechanisms whilst crack initiation can be attributed to distinct causes, either the presence of defects in the surface of the blade due to impact of debris or intrinsic material defects or some degrading mechanisms affecting the internal microstructure of the material. In some cases the blades were in service after having being object of an overhaul procedure, which can justify some crack initiation cases that caused in service failures.
1	Abstract   A simple scheme for monitoring the alignment status between the pulse carver and the data modulator in both return-to-zero differential phase-shift keying (RZ-DPSK) and return-to-zero ON–OFF keying (RZ-OOK) systems is proposed and experimentally demonstrated. Not relying on any high-speed components, the scheme needs only an athermal delay-interferometer with properly designed delay and one or two optical power meters. For 10-Gb/s RZ-DPSK signals with a duty cycle of 50%, a large monitoring power dynamic range (MPDR) of ∼13 dB was observed using differential monitoring. For 10-Gb/s RZ-OOK signals, the MPDR of ∼2 dB was also observed. The feasibility of the proposed scheme for RZ-DPSK and RZ-OOK signals with a duty cycle of 33% was also investigated. The proposed scheme is also applicable to the single-modulator transmitter configuration, in which the data signal and the clock are mixed in the electrical domain.
1	Abstract   In this paper, the time-series modeling techniques of grinding forces is used to identify over-grinding induced by thermal convex deformation within one pass. It is shown that the earlier the over-grinding is detected the better are the opportunities to avoid the detrimental features of this phenomenon, therefore, prediction is an important feature of monitoring strategy.
1	Abstract   Impact response of fiber-reinforced aerated concrete was investigated under a three-point bending configuration based on free-fall of an instrumented impact device. Two types of aerated concrete: plain autoclaved aerated concrete (AAC) and polymeric fiber-reinforced aerated concrete (FRAC) were tested. Comparisons were made in terms of stiffness, flexural strength, deformation capacity and energy absorption capacity. The effect of impact energy on the mechanical properties was investigated for various drop heights and different specimen sizes. It was observed that dynamic flexural strength under impact was more than 1.5 times higher than the static flexural strength. Both materials showed similar flexural load carrying capacity under impact, however, use of 0.5% volume fraction of polypropylene fibers resulted in more than three times higher flexural toughness. The performed instrumented impact test was found to be a good method for quantifying the impact resistance of cement-based materials such as aerated concrete masonry products.

Firstly, the resistance of metallic carbon nanotube interconnects are obtained from first principles simulations and the voltage dependence of the resistance is modeled through neural networks. Self-consistent non-equilibrium Green's function formalism combined with density functional theory is used for calculating the voltage-dependent resistance of metallic carbon nanotubes. It is shown that voltage dependent resistances of carbon nanotubes obtained from ab initio simulations can be accurately modeled via neural networks which enable rapid integration of carbon nanotube interconnect models into electronic design automation tools.
1	Bees Algorithm is a relatively new member of swarm intelligence based meta-heuristics which tries to model natural behavior of real honey bees in food foraging. Honey bees use several mechanisms like waggle dance to optimally locate food sources and to search new ones. This makes them a good candidate for developing new search algorithms for solving optimization problems in operational research. On the other hand, two-sided assembly lines are generally occurred in assembly of large-sized products such as buses and trucks. In a two-sided assembly line, different assembly tasks are carried out on the same product in parallel to both left and right sides of the line. In this study Bees Algorithm is adopted to solve two-sided assembly line balancing problem with zoning constraint so as to minimize the number of stations for a given cycle time. An extensive computational study is carried out and the results are compared with the results of several algorithms from the literature with the results of exact solution approaches and several algorithms from the literature such as ant colony optimization, tabu search.
1	We explore models of social influence in an open multi-agent system market scenario.Consumer choice is informed by peer recommendations in an evolving social network.We compare the behaviour of two algorithms for selecting recommending peers.We study the link between selection algorithms and the emergent network topologies.We study the impact of the peer selection algorithms on the agents' performance. Open multi-agent systems are typically formed from heterogeneous peers operating in a decentralised manner. Hence, their constituent agents must evaluate possible actions and opportunities based on local, subjective knowledge. When agents have insufficient personal experience, they may inevitably rely on their social connections to act as a source of relevant information or recommendations. We describe an agent-mediated electronic market for investigating social interaction within the context of evolving heterogeneous distributed networks. In our scenario, consumers look for appropriate services and this service choice is informed via peer recommendations. We define two alternative algorithms for selecting peers based on perceived similarity and we evaluate them on their ability to organise an overlay network such that it acts as a passive filter, tailoring the information that agents use to select services in the market. We use this scenario to explore the link between the peer selection algorithms and the emergent network topologies, as well as the impact of the peer selection algorithm on the agents' performance in choosing services based on peer recommendations. Our simulation results demonstrate a qualitative difference in the behaviour of the algorithms, with optimal algorithm selection relying on information regarding the preferences of the wider population of agents.
1	Among the most interesting measures in intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFSs) theory, the similarity measure is an essential tool to compare and determine degree of similarity between IFSs. Although there exist many similarity measures for IFSs, most of them cannot satisfy the axioms of similarity measure or provide reasonable results. In this paper, a novel knowledge-based similarity/dissimilarity measure between IFSs is proposed. Firstly, we define a new knowledge measure of information conveyed by the IFS and prove some properties of the proposed knowledge measure. Based on the proposed knowledge measure of IFSs, we construct a novel similarity/dissimilarity measure between IFSs and prove some properties of the proposed similarity measure. Then we use some illustrative examples to show that the proposed measures, though simple in concept and calculus, can overcome the drawbacks of the existing measures. Finally, we apply the proposed similarity/dissimilarity measure between IFSs in the pattern recognition problems to demonstrate that the proposed measure is the most reliable to deal with the pattern recognition problem in comparison with the existing similarity measures. New similarity/dissimilarity measure for intuitionistic fuzzy sets.The measure discriminates similarity and dissimilarity between two intuitionistic fuzzy sets.We construct a new similarity/dissimilarity measure based on knowledge measure.The knowledge-based similarity/dissimilarity measure overcomes the existing measures.Reliable measure for intuitionistic fuzzy information in pattern recognition.
0	Abstract   Most previous studies on digital magnetic heterostructures have been concerned with materials containing d-block and f-block magnetic ions. In this work, we predicted several alkaline-earth monoxide-based digital magnetic heterostructures via anionic substitution by main group elements, exhibiting sp-electron ferromagnetism. First-principles calculations were performed to investigate rock-salt CaO δ-doped with 2p-block elements B, C, and N atoms. Semiconducting and half-metallic ferromagnetic states were found and identified. Spin polarization was mainly derived from the 2p holes induced by substitution, i.e., replacing oxygen with boron, carbon, and nitrogen. The orbital-specific spin-polarized states were characterized and the relationships between the electronic structures and magnetic properties were described and explained. Moreover, the carriers were mostly concentrated within a narrowly confined area around the δ-doped layers, and were for the most part not acted on the host layers, showing a spin polarization of the two-dimensional hole gas.
1	Real-time road traffic prediction is a fundamental capability needed to make use of advanced, smart transportation technologies. Both from the point of view of network operators as well as from the point of view of travelers wishing real-time route guidance, accurate short-term traffic prediction is a necessary first step. While techniques for short-term traffic prediction have existed for some time, emerging smart transportation technologies require the traffic prediction capability to be both fast and scalable to full urban networks. We present a method that has proven to be able to meet this challenge. The method presented provides predictions of speed and volume over 5-min intervals for up to 1 h in advance.
0	The onset of plasticity in Cr was investigated by nanoindentation using indenters with tip radii ranging from 60 to 759 nm. The stress for incipient plasticity was found to increase with decreasing tip radius. We find that the cumulative pop-in probability on load could be described successfully by a combined model over the full range of tip radius, indicating that the incipient plasticity might be triggered either by the homogeneous nucleation of dislocation or by the activation of existing dislocations underneath the indenter.
1	Abstract   It is a fact that in auxiliary equation methods, the exact solutions of different types of auxiliary equations may produce new types of exact travelling wave solutions to nonlinear equations. In this manner, various auxiliary equations of first-order nonlinear ordinary differential equation with distinct-degree nonlinear terms are examined and, by means of symbolic computation, the new solutions of original auxiliary equation of first-order nonlinear ordinary differential equation with sixth-degree nonlinear term are presented. Consequently, the novel exact solutions of the generalized Klein–Gordon equation and the active-dissipative dispersive media equation are found out for illustration purposes. They are also applicable, where conventional perturbation method fails to provide any solution of the nonlinear problems under study.

Bilinear forms, Backlund transformation and Lax pair are derived based on the Bell polynomials and symbolic computation. One- and two-soliton solutions with a real function  ϕ ( y ) are constructed via the Hirota method, where  y  is the scaled space coordinate. Propagation and interaction of the solitons are illustrated graphically: (i)  ϕ ( y ) affects the shape of the solitons. (ii) Interaction of the solitons including the elastic and inelastic interactions are discussed. When the solitons’ interaction is elastic, the amplitude, velocity and shape of the soliton remain invariant after the interaction except for a phase shift, and the smaller-amplitude soliton has a larger phase shift. (iii) Height of the water surface above a horizontal bottom can be a bell-shaped soliton or an upside-down bell-shaped soliton under certain conditions, while horizontal velocity of the water wave always keeps bell-shaped.
1	Abstract   A novel messages spreading model is suggested in this paper. The model is a natural generalization of the SIS (susceptible-infective-susceptible) model, in which two relevant messages with same probability of acceptance may spread among nodes. One of the messages has a higher priority to be adopted than the other only in the sense that both messages act on the same node simultaneously. Node in the model is termed as supporter when it adopts either of messages. The transition probability allows that two kinds of supports may transform into each other with a certain rate, and it varies inversely with the associated levels which are discretely distributed in the symmetrical interval around original point. Results of numerical simulations show that individuals tend to believe the messages with a better consistency. If messages are conflicting with each other, the one with higher priority would be spread more and another would be ignored. Otherwise, the number of both supports remains at a uniformly higher level. Besides, in a network with lower connected degree, over a half of the individuals would keep neutral, and the message with lower priority becomes harder to diffuse than the prerogative one. This paper explores the propagation of multi-messages by considering their correlation degree, contributing to the understanding and predicting of the potential propagation trends.
1	Abstract   We numerically and experimentally investigate the underlying mechanism leading to multiple resonances in the FitzHugh-Nagumo model driven by a bichromatic excitation. Using a FitzHugh-Nagumo circuit, we first analyze the number of spikes triggered by the system in response to a single sinusoidal wave forcing. We build an encoding diagram where different phase-locking modes are identified according to the amplitude and frequency of the sinusoidal excitation. Next, we consider the bichromatic driving which consists in a low frequency sinusoidal wave perturbed by an additive high frequency signal. Beside the classical Vibrational Resonance phenomenon, we show in real experiments that multiple resonances can be reached by an appropriate setting of the perturbation parameters. We clearly establish a correlation between these resonances and the encoding diagram of the low frequency signal free FitzHugh-Nagumo model. We show with realistic parameters that sharp transitions of the encoding diagram allow to predict the main resonances. Our experiments are confirmed by numerical simulations of the system response.
0	Methane drainage has become an integral part of modern coal mining operations when gas emissions cannot be practically dealt with using conventional ventilation methods alone. Boreholes are often drilled above and below the caving zone and connected to a drainage range located along the return gate. This paper describes the construction and analysis of the results obtained from the two- and three- dimensional geomechanical and gas flow models experienced around an active deep UK longwall coal production panel. The models constructed using the commercial FLAC codes were undertaken to provide information to the ventilation engineers at the mine on the likely gas sources and gas flow paths into the face line areas and gate roads. This information allows for the correct design of the orientation, length and support of the boreholes to maximise gas capture. The paper describes the method adopted to derive the relevant rock mass parameters and the laboratory tests conducted to obtain the stress-dependent permeability of coal measure rock strata. A functional relationship is proposed whereby the intrinsic bulk permeability of a sheared coal measure rock may be predicted from the confining stress. A detailed discussion of the geomechanical modelling methodology and the derivation of the strata permeabilities and gas flow modelling adopted is presented. The output of the models is described and used to interpret the major potential gas sources and pathway into the workings.
1	In this paper, a novel identification methodology is proposed to capture general multivariate nonlinear relationships, with focus on the bounded-error approximation of model predictive control for constrained (non)linear systems. The formulation of the identification problem takes, at each iteration, the form of a constrained linear (or quadratic) optimization problem that is mathematically feasible as well as numerically tractable. The efficiency of the proposed method for the derivation of low-complexity explicit model predictive controllers is demonstrated via the constrained control of a thermodynamic power plant.
1	The implementation of lightweight high-performance motion systems in lithography and other applications imposes lower requirements on actuators, amplifiers, and cooling. However, the decreased stiffness of lightweight designs increases the effect of structural flexibilities especially when the point of interest is not at a fixed location. This is for example occurring when exposing a silicon wafer. The present work addresses the problem of compliance compensation in flexible structures, when the performance location is time-varying. The compliance function is derived using the frequency domain representation of the solution of the partial differential equation (PDE) describing the structure. The method is validated by simulation results.
1	Abstract   In this paper, the problem of designing a cyber-resilient controller is studied for a class of nonlinear discrete systems subject to actuator attacks. We develop a coupled control design approach, which incorporates interaction between the intrusion detection system (IDS) and the attacker, with the controller design in the physical layer. In the considered cyber-attack scenario, the attacker attempts to first bypass the IDS to spoof the system actuator and then deteriorate the controller performance in the physical layer. The optimal attack strategy to deceive the IDS is obtained based on a zero-sum game in the detection layer. In the physical layer, it is assumed that the system has a secure compensator along with the actuator to deal with the injected attack values. Therefore, the controller and the compensator are designed based on the results of the game in the detection layer, and stochastic stability analysis and Lyapunov function methods are used to prove boundedness of the system state in the probabilistic sense. Finally, through numerical analysis of a representative example, the proposed design procedure is illustrated and its efficacy in maintaining robust stability of the cyber-physical system under actuator attacks is demonstrated.
0	Abstract   The method of enhancing the biodegradability of landfill leachate via air stripping followed by coagulation/ultrafiltration (UF) processes is introduced. In this study, the air stripping process obtained a removal efficiency of 88.6% for ammonia nitrogen (NH 3 -N), at an air-to-liquid ratio (A/L) of 3 300 (pH = 11) and after 18 h of stripping. The single coagulation process increased the BOD (biological oxygen demand)/COD (chemical oxygen demand) ratio by 0.089 with a FeCl 3  dosage of 570 mg/L, at pH 7.0, and the single UF process increased the BOD/COD ratio from 0.049 to 0.311. However, the combination of coagulation and UF increased the BOD/COD ratio from 0.049 to 0.423, and the final BOD, COD, NH3-N, and colour of the leachate were 1 023 mg/L, 2 845 mg/L, 145 mg/L, and 2 056, respectively, when a 3 kDa molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) membrane was used at an operating pressure of 0.7 MPa. In the ultrafiltration process, the average solution flux ( J  V ), concentration multiple ( M  C ), and retention rate ( R ) for the COD were 107.3 L/(m 2 ·h), 6.3, and 84.2%, respectively.
1	Abstract   The Xiaolangdi Reservoir has entered the later sediment-retaining period, and new sediment transport phenomena and channel re-establishing behaviors are appearing. A physical model test was used to forecast the scouring and silting trends of the lower Yellow River. Based on water and sediment data from the lower Yellow River during the period from 1960 to 2012, and using a statistical method, this paper analyzed the sediment transport in sediment-laden flows with different discharges and sediment concentrations in the lower Yellow River. The results show that rational water-sediment regulation is necessary to avoid silting in the later sediment-retaining period. The combination of 3 000 m3/s
1	In this paper, finite-time synchronization for a class of fuzzy cellular neural networks with time-varying delays is investigated based on the finite-time stability theory. By applying the inequality technique and the analysis method, some new and useful criteria of finite-time synchronization for the addressed network are derived in terms of p-norm. Finally, two examples with their numerical simulations are given to show the feasibility and effectiveness of the developed synchronization method.
0	Amorphous hydrogenated carbon (a-C:H) thin films deposited by r.f. chemical vapor deposition were applied as mask to anisotropic etching of crystalline silicon by aqueous solution of Ethylenediamine with Pyrocatechol (EDP). Films with thicknesses of approximately 100 nm were successfully patterned on silicon slices by the lift-off process. Then the masked samples were submitted to one aqueous EDP solution during time intervals of 8, 16, 24 and 100 min at a temperature of 98°C. The inspection showed well defined etching pattern and absence of etch pits on the surface underneath the film indicating the high chemical resistance of the a-C:H film to the aqueous EDP solution.
1	A novel technique to improve the linearity of Low Noise Amplifier (LNA) based on pre-distortion in the input matching circuit is proposed. The linearization technique is applied to a Capacitive Cross Coupled Common Gate (CCC-CG) structure. An auxiliary transistor operating in weak inversion region is used to adjust the input matching circuit nonlinearity. It has been shown that the nonlinearity of input matching circuit can efficiently compensate the nonlinearity of transconductance (Gm) of the amplifier, and improves the third Input Intercept Point (IIP3). Furthermore, the added transistor is used in a feedback path which provides a noise canceling scheme. Thus, linearity improvement is achieved in addition to low Noise Figure (NF). Post-layout simulation results in TSMC 0.18m CMOS technology, show a gain of 18.55dB with an upper 3dB frequency of 2.96GHz, the minimum NF equals to 2.63dB and IIP3 of 11dBm, while consuming 2.77mA from a 1.5V supply. In this paper a new technique based on pre-distortion in the input matching circuit is proposed to improve the linearity of Low Noise Amplifier (LNA).A Capacitive Cross Coupled Common Gate based LNA with high linearity is presented based on the proposed idea.Besides pre-distortion performance, the auxiliary transistor forms a noise canceling scheme and partially cancel out the channel thermal noise of main amplifying transistor.The circuit is inductoreless and suitable for wideband low power applications.
0	Abstract   Advanced analytics can enable manufacturing engineers to improve product quality and achieve equipment and resource efficiency gains using large amounts of data collected during manufacturing. Manufacturing engineers, however, often lack the expertise to apply advanced analytics, relying instead on frequent consultations with data scientists. Furthermore, collaborations between manufacturing engineers and data scientists have resulted in highly specialized applications that are not relevant to broader use cases. The manufacturing industry can benefit from the techniques applied in these collaborations if they can be generalized for a wide range of manufacturing problems without requiring a strong knowledge about analytical models.  This paper first presents a model-based methodology to help manufacturing engineers who have little or no experience in advanced analytics apply machine learning techniques for manufacturing problems. This methodology includes a meta-model repository and model transformations. The meta-models define concepts and rules that are commonly known in the manufacturing industry in order to facilitate the creation of manufacturing models. The model transformations enable the semi-automatic generation of analytical models using a given manufacturing model. Second, a model-based Tool for ADvanced Analytics in Manufacturing (TADAM) is presented to allow manufacturing engineers to apply the methodology. TADAM offers capabilities to generate neural networks for manufacturing process problems. Using TADAM’s graphical user interface, a manufacturing engineer can build a model for a given process to provide: 1) the key performance indicator (KPI) to be predicted, and 2) the variables contributing to this KPI. Once the manufacturing engineer has built the model and provided the associated data, the model transformations available in TADAM can be called to generate a trained neural network. Finally, the benefits of TADAM are demonstrated in a manufacturing use case in which a manufacturing engineer generates a neural network to predict the energy consumption of a milling process.
1	A method for immobilization of Candida rugosa lipase to two types of chitosan beads by activating the hydroxyl groups of chitosan using carbodiimide coupling agent has been successfully developed. The ability of carbodiimide to activate the hydroxyl groups of chitosan was confirmed using the electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis (ESCA) technique. The properties of lipase immobilized using dry and wet chitosan beads were also investigated and compared. Immobilization enhanced the enzyme stability against changes of pH and temperature. High storage stability of 30 days and an increased enzyme activity of 2,110% were observed in wet immobilized lipase. Immobilized lipase using dry and wet chitosan beads retained 78% and 85% of its initial activity after 10 batch hydrolytic cycles. The kinetic parameters Km and Vmax were determined for the free and immobilized lipase. The activation energy (Ea) was found to decrease for immobilization of lipase on chitosan beads.
0	Some biological properties of a range of biphasic calcium phosphate (BCP) granules were quantified using a co-culture model of primary unstimulated human osteoblasts and macrophages. The BCP granules were classified in terms of diameter and the ratio of tricalcium phosphate (TCP): hydroxyapatite (HA). All granules were 50% porous and sterilised by γ-irradiation. Primary unstimulated human osteoblasts and macrophages were cultured in contact with the range of BCP granules for 1, 7 and 14 days. The response of the cells was determined and quantified by the assessment of viable cell adhesion to the substrate, using lactate dehydrogenase assay, and the production and release of the cytokines; interleukin 1β, (IL-1β), tumour necrosis factor α (TNF-α) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). Throughout the test period viable cell adhesion on all BCP granules was significantly lower than the tissue culture polystyrene control. Higher content TCP materials, (80% and 100% TCP) did not support viable cell adhesion after 1 day, lower content TCP materials, (20% and 50% TCP) granules did support viable cell adhesion throughout the time period. The percentage content of TCP was a more significant factor than granule size within the test conditions at all time points.
0	Lipase Candida rugosa was entrapped in silicone rubber via condensation-cure room temperature vulcanization of silanol-terminated poly(dimethylsiloxane) with tetraethyl orthosilicate as a crosslinker, to give a highly active silicone-enzyme elastomer. The effect on enzyme activity of addition of water and hydrophilic polymeric moieties based on poly(ethylene oxide) 2 was examined, as were crosslinker concentration, enzyme concentration, and elastomer thickness. It was demonstrated that lipase is most active in silicone elastomers and more active in silicone oils than simple hydrocarbons. Crosslink density in these elastomers was not an important factor in the reactivity of the rubber. However, the addition of hydrophilic species prior to elastomer formation decreased the efficiency both of the dispersion of the enzyme and the resulting activity of the elastomer. This effect could be moderated by prior exposure of the lipase to silicone oil. Thus, hydrophobic silicones play a protective/activating role for lipase.
1	Abstract   We present here a multi-objective and multi-disciplinary coronary stent design optimization paradigm. Coronary stents are tubular, often mesh-like, structures which are deployed in diseased (stenosed) artery segments to provide a scaffolding feature that compresses atheromatus plaque, hence restoring luminal area and maintaining vessel patency. A three variable geometry parameterisation of a CYPHER (Cordis Corporation, Johnson &amp; Johnson co.) type stent is proposed to explore the functionality of a sequence of circumferential rings connected by ‘n’ shaped links. The performance of each design is measured by six figures of merit (objectives/metrics) representing (i) acute recoil, (ii) tissue stresses, (iii) haemodynamic disturbance, (iv) drug delivery, (v) uniformity of drug distribution, and (vi) flexibility. These metrics are obtained from computational simulations of (i) structural deformation through balloon inflated expansion of a stent into contact with a stenosed vessel, (ii) pulsatile flow over the deformed stent embedded in the vessel wall, (iii) steady-state drug distribution into the tissue, and (iv) flexibility of a stent in response to an applied moment. Design improvement is obtained by a multi-objective surrogate modelling approach using a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) to search for an optimal family of designs. A number of trade-offs between the different objectives are identified. In particular a conflict between pairs of the following objectives are shown -- (a) volume average stress vs. recoil, (b) volume average drug vs. volume average stress, (c) flexibility vs. volume average stress, (d) flexibility vs. haemodynamic disturbance, (e) volume average drug vs. haemodynamic disturbance, and (f) uniformity of drug vs. volume average stress. Different paradigms to choose the optimal designs from the obtained Pareto fronts are presented and under each such paradigm, the optimal designs and there relative positions with respect to a representative CYPHER stent are shown. The methodology and the results of this work could potentially be useful in further optimisation studies and development of a family of stents with increased resistance to in-stent restenosis and thrombosis.
0	Abstract   The natural anionic polysaccharide hyaluronic acid (HA) was modified by introducing reduction-sensitive disulfide bond between the carboxyl groups and the backbone of HA (HA-SS-COOH). HA-SS-COOH and its corresponding unmodified stable analog HA were used to shield DNA/PEI polyplexes (DP) to form ternary complexes (DPS and DPH complexes). The shielding/deshielding effect was tested along with size, zeta potential, cell viability and transfection. Both DPS and DPH complexes showed increase in size, decrease in zeta potential and low cytotoxicity in physiological conditions due to the anionic shielding. In the reductive environment, only HA-SS-COOH coated ternary complexes (DPS) demonstrated the size increase and recovered high positive zeta potential. DPS complexes showed an up to 14-fold higher transfection than the stable coated one, indicating the efficiency of the reduction-responsive deshielding design. Moreover, the presence of extra free HA inhibited the transfection of DPS on HepG2 and B16F10 cells with HA receptor expression, while displaying no effect on non-targeted NIH3T3 cells. More rapid cellular association of DPS with HepG2 was observed, thus confirming the targeting reservation of disulfide bond modified HA. Intratumoral injection of DPS complexes resulted in much higher accumulation and luciferase expression in the tumor bearing C57BL/6 mice. Both  in vitro  and  in vivo  results demonstrated the successful combination of deshielding and target functions in HA derivatives for gene delivery.
1	Abstract   To develop RNA-based therapeutics, it is crucial to create delivery vectors that transport the RNA molecule into the cell cytoplasm. Naturally released exosomes vesicles (also called “Extracellular Vesicles”) have been proposed as possible RNAi carriers, but their yield is relatively small in any cell culture system. We have previously generated exosome-mimetic nanovesicles (NV) by serial extrusions of cells through nano-sized filters, which results in 100-times higher yield of extracellular vesicles. We here test 1) whether NV can be loaded with siRNA exogenously and endogenously, 2) whether the siRNA-loaded NV are taken up by recipient cells, and 3) whether the siRNA can induce functional knock-down responses in recipient cells. A siRNA against GFP was first loaded into NV by electroporation, or a c-Myc shRNA was expressed inside of the cells. The NV were efficiently loaded with siRNA with both techniques, were taken up by recipient cells, which resulted in attenuation of target gene expression. In conclusion, our study suggests that exosome-mimetic nanovesicles can be a platform for RNAi delivery to cell cytoplasm.
1	Abstract   To determine the full-field high-temperature thermal deformation of the structural materials used in high-speed aerospace flight vehicles, a novel non-contact high-temperature deformation measurement system is established by combining transient aerodynamic heating simulation device with the reliability-guided digital image correlation (RG-DIC). The test planar sample with size varying from several mm 2  to several hundreds mm 2  can be heated from room temperature to 1100 °C rapidly and accurately using the infrared radiator of the transient aerodynamic heating simulation system. The digital images of the test sample surface at various temperatures are recorded using an ordinary optical imaging system. To cope with the possible local decorrelated regions caused by black-body radiation within the deformed images at the temperatures over 450 °C, the RG-DIC technique is used to extract full-field in-plane thermal deformation from the recorded images. In validation test, the thermal deformation fields and the values of coefficient of thermal expansion (CTEs) of a chromiumnickel austenite stainless steel sample from room temperature to 550 °C is measured and compared with the well-established handbook value, confirming the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed technique. The experimental results reveal that the present system using an ordinary optical imaging system, is able to accurately measure full-field thermal deformation of metals and alloys at temperatures not exceeding 600 °C.
1	Abstract   Laser perforating is a new method in oil and gas wells where researchers look for an alternative to explosive methods. One of the important problems with this method is the generation of uniform and cylindrical holes at a selected pitch for enhancing the permeability of rocks. In non-moving laser perforation, the nozzle of the laser and the rock do not approach each other and due to laser convergence in a point, uniform and cylindrical holes are not created. For this reason, moving laser perforation is suggested in this research. One of the important parameters in moving laser perforation is the power of the laser that can be perforated at a specific rate. In this article we predicted the laser power for a definite rate of perforation (ROP) and then the accuracy of this prediction was evaluated to support the experiments. A pulsed Nd: YAG laser, with a pulse energy around 5.5 J, pulse repetition rate of 30 Hz and pulse duration of 2 ms were used for rock perforation in this study. The results shows that the presented relation for perforation could reliably be used in practice. Furthermore, by knowing the rate of perforation, the required laser power for consistent drilling could be calculated.
1	Abstract   During the entire evolution of life on Earth, the development of all organisms took place under constant gravity conditions, against which they achieved specific countermeasures for compensation and adaptation. On this background, it is still an open question to which extent altered gravity such as hypergravity (centrifuge) or microgravity (spaceflight) affects the normal individual development, either on the systemic level of the whole organism or on the level of individual organs or even single cells. The present review provides information on these questions, comprising gravistimulated effects on invertebrates and vertebrates (with the exception of mammals, since respective biomedically oriented reviews abound), focusing on developing fish as model systems, with special emphasis on the effect of altered gravity on the developing brain and vestibular system, comprising investigations on behaviour and plastic reactivities of the brain and inner ear.  Clues and insights into the possible basic causes of space motion sickness-phenomena (SMS; a kinetosis) are provided as well as perspectives in regard to future work to be done including studies on the ISS concerning the analysis of gravistimulated effects on developmental issues (imprinting phase for graviperception?).
1	The Antarctic cryptoendolithic fungi of the ice-free desert could have evolved genetically and geographically isolated since the separation of the Continent from the Gondwanaland. The resulting harsh environmental conditions due to the migration of Antarctica to the South Pole led to a strong selective pressure possibly promoting adaptive radiation and speciation. Microorganisms evolved during this unique process are adapted to colonize what is known as the closest Martian environment on Earth. For this reason they have been already suggested as the best eukaryotic model for exobiological speculations. The results on freeze and thawing, UV exposure and osmotic stress tolerance here reported highlight an uncommon ability of surviving under these external pressures. Studies on their ability to withstand space conditions are in progress in view of the opportunity of direct space exposure on the International Space Station. The results could give new tools to solve the conflict concerning the Panspermia hypothesis. � 2007 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
1	Abstract   This paper presents the first results of total electron content (TEC), derived by analyzing dual frequency Novatel GSV4004 GPS receiver’s data which were installed by the SCINDA project, located at the Asian Institute of Technology, Bangkok (AITB, 14.079N, 100.612E) and Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai (CHGM, 18.480N, 98.570E) with magnetic latitude of 4.13°N and 8.61°N respectively in Thailand, for the year 2011. These two stations are separated by 657 km in the equatorial anomaly region. The highest TEC values occurred from 1500 to 1900 LT throughout the study period. The diurnal, monthly and seasonal GPS-TEC have been plotted and analyzed. The diurnal peaks in GPS-TEC is observed to be maximum during equinoctial months (March, April, September and October) and minimum in solstice months (January, February, June, July and December). These high TEC values have been attributed to the solar extreme ultra-violet ionization coupled with the upward vertical E × B drift. A comparison of both station’s TEC has been carried out and found that CHGM station experiences higher values of TEC than AITB station, due to formation of ionization crest over the CHGM station. Also, TEC values have shown increasing trend due to approaching solar maximum. These results from both stations were also compared with the TEC derived from the International Reference Ionosphere’s (IRI) recently released, IRI-2012 model. Results have shown positive correlation with IRI-2012 model. Although, IRI-model does not show any response to geomagnetic activity, the IRI model normally remains smooth and underestimates TEC during a storm.
1	A deterministic attitude estimation problem for a rigid body in a potential field, with bounded attitude and angular velocity measurement errors is considered. An attitude estimation algorithm that globally minimizes the attitude estimation error is obtained. Assuming that the initial attitude, the initial angular velocity and measurement noise lie within given ellipsoidal bounds, an uncertainty ellipsoid that bounds the attitude and the angular velocity of the rigid body is obtained. The center of the uncertainty ellipsoid provides point estimates, and the size of the uncertainty ellipsoid measures the accuracy of the estimates. The point estimates and the uncertainty ellipsoids are propagated using a Lie group variational integrator and its linearization, respectively. The attitude and angular velocity estimates are optimal in the sense that the sizes of the uncertainty ellipsoids are minimized.

0	Piezoelectric materials are usually bonded to elastic substrates to form so-called smart material structures that are capable of sensing and actuating in a controlled manner in response to a stimulus. Such smart structures are often operated at transient electromechanical environments. In this paper, the problem of a periodic array of surface cracks in a piezoelectric layer bonded to an elastic substrate subjected to transient electromechanical loads is studied. A system of singular integral equations is formulated in terms of the crack surface displacement and electric potential. Numerical results include the time-dependent stress and electric displacement intensity factors. Effects of crack spacing and electromechanical coupling on the crack tip field intensity factors are investigated in details. Numerical examples are given for a single piezoelectric layer and a piezoelectric layer bonded to an elastic substrate, subjected to independent mechanical and electrical impact loads. Some useful conclusions are given.
1	Abstract   In this paper, the fully coupled rolling contact problem of a graded coating/substrate system under the action of a rigid cylinder is investigated. Using the singular integral equation approach, the governing equations of the rolling contact problem are constructed for all possible stick/slip regimes. Applying the Gauss–Chebyshev numerical integration method, the governing equations are converted to systems of algebraic equations. A new numerical algorithm is proposed to solve these systems of equations. Both the coupled and the uncoupled solutions to the problem are found through an implemented iterative procedure. In Part I of this paper, the analytical formulation of the rolling contact problem and the discretization of the governing equations are introduced for all assumed stick/slip regimes. A detailed discussion of the proposed numerical algorithm, the iteration procedure and the numerical results, obtained using the analytical formulation, are given in Part II.
0	Abstract   Many pharmaceutical products are obtained via freeze-drying of liquid solutions to obtain stable long lasting preparations. The freeze-dry process produces porous cakes whose structure strongly depends on the freezing phase, so that monitoring and optimizing this phase can help both reducing the product cost and insuring its constant quality. Nowadays the optimization is usually performed by determining the cake mass transfer coefficient via a costly process in pilot plants, while the quality is assured only by controlling the process conditions. This paper describes an alternative way of approximately estimating the mass transfer coefficient, which is based on the observation of the product structure by a simple electron microscope followed by a frequency domain imaging process. While the process has been designed and characterized specifically for pharmaceutical products, the proposed approach can be used in several other fields where the characteristics of porous material have to be monitored.
1	Abstract   The research reported in this paper is related to the ultra-wide-band radar technology that may be employed in care services for elderly and disabled persons. Three algorithms for preprocessing of measurement data from an impulse radar sensor, when applied for such people monitoring, are compared with respect to the uncertainty of estimation of echo parameters. These are: an algorithm based on the maximum-envelope of the measured radar data, an algorithm based on curve-fitting in the spectrum domain of those data, and a modified CLEAN algorithm. Results of the numerical experiments performed on both semi-synthetic data and real-world data, obtained by means of an impulse-radar sensor, are demonstrated.
1	Most object recognition methods rely on contour-defined features obtained by edge detection or region segmentation. They are not robust to diffuse region boundaries. Furthermore, such methods do not exploit region color information. We propose color-blob-based COSFIRE (Combination of Shifted Filter Responses) filters to be selective for combinations of diffuse circular regions (blobs) in specific mutual spatial arrangements. Such a filter combines the responses of a certain selection of Difference-of-Gaussians filters, essentially blob detectors, of different scales, in certain channels of a color space, and at certain relative positions to each other. Its parameters are determined/learned in an automatic configuration process that analyzes the properties of a given prototype object of interest. We use these filters to compute features that are effective for the recognition of the prototype objects. We form feature vectors that we use with an SVM classifier. We evaluate the proposed method on a traffic sign (GTSRB) and a butterfly data sets. For the GTSRB data set we achieve a recognition rate of 98.94%, which is slightly higher than human performance and for the butterfly data set we achieve 89.02%. The proposed color-blob-based COSFIRE filters are very effective and outperform the contour-based COSFIRE filters. A COSFIRE filter is trainable, it can be configured with a single prototype pattern and it does not require domain knowledge. Display Omitted We propose novel color-blob-based COSFIRE filters.They are effective for recognizing also objects with diffuse region boundaries.Such a filter models (a part of) an object by a specific arrangement of color blobs.The blobs contain information about the sizes and colors of the interior of regions.We achieve high recognition rates: GTSRB (98.94%) and butterfly (89.02%) data sets.
1	Abstract   A high-velocity impact interaction of a polyethylene projectile (15 mm diameter) and aluminium projectile (6.35 mm diameter) with string and mesh bumpers (made of steel strings of 0.5–1.0 mm in diameter) was investigated experimentally and numerically. The study was aimed on detecting the projectile fragmentation peculiarities during projectile interaction with discrete bumpers. Since polyethylene has lower penetration resistance than aluminium, the effects inherent to discrete bumper penetration into the projectile must be more obvious for polyethylene. The string bumper is a set of parallel strings lying in a plane. The geometry of the string bumper which is simpler than the geometry of the mesh one also allowed one to get more understandable distribution of fragments on a thick aluminium witness-plate which was imposed behind the studied bumper to register the results of impact interaction for further analysis. The projectile velocity varied in the range of 1.7–3.8 km/s. The geometrical properties of such bumper-projectile system were characterized by two geometrical parameters: the parameter  κ  characterizing the bumper discreteness and equal to cell aperture-string diameter ratio, and the parameter  ɛ  defining the average number of cells falling within the projectile diameter.  According to the experiments, the projectile destruction on string and mesh bumpers is especially distinguished by the accompanying formation of jets of fragments which are ejected from the front part of the projectile along and across its movement direction. The number of the jets correlates with the number of discrete bumper cells arriving at the projectile. The jets intensity depends on the impact velocity and values of the both geometrical parameters  κ  and  ɛ ; the action of the jets on the witness plate (evaluated by the craters depth) can exceed the action of the remaining projectile mass. The numerical modelling evaluates the revealed cumulative effect as follows: the velocity of the fragments in the jets exceeds the original projectile velocity up to factor of ˜1.5 in case when the projectile is aimed towards a cell centre.  The experiments and calculations show that projectile destruction and fragmentation on the string and mesh bumpers are characterized not only by the formation of the jets ejected from the front part of the projectile but also by the shock-wave destruction of rear part of the projectile. The latter is the mechanism, which is inherent to a high-velocity impact on continuous bumpers. Which of these mechanisms prevails depends on the  κ  and  ɛ  parameters values. Frontal fragmentation dominates if the bumper has higher aperture of cells while at lower aperture the part of the projectile mass fragmented due to the formation of the jets diminishes significantly and the shock-wave destruction of projectile prevails. Numerical modelling also explains the mechanism of the formation of craters groups linearly distributed over the witness surface which were observed in the earlier experiments on projectile fragmentation upon the mesh bumpers.  In addition, experiments on the high-velocity interaction of an aluminium projectile with two spaced string bumpers were carried out in case when the aperture of the string cell exceeded the projectile radius. Despite the lower areal density and small inter-bumper distance, the successive string bumpers revealed extremely higher ability to break up the projectile. Intensive fragmentation occurred even in the range of velocities that was lower than a threshold velocity at which the fragmentation of the projectile would have begun on a continuous aluminum bumper with the equal areal density. Numerical modelling makes clear the mechanics of the interaction of the projectile with the spaced string bumpers of the higher aperture.
1	Abstract   The aim of this paper is to propose an interpolation algorithm for tracing the equidistant (bisector) of two planar curves. The structure of the algorithm may be adapted accordingly so as to be used either for purely computing purposes or for presentation purposes. As a computing tool, the algorithm is suitable for computation of offset intersections and construction of Voronoi diagrams. In this case the step size is adjusted appropriately in order to reach the desired position in a small number of steps but with high accuracy. As a presentation tool, it may be embedded in a CAD system, entrusted with the task of drawing equidistants or even it may be used for plotting equidistants by driving the plotting tip. In this case, a fixed step size is selected to satisfy the specific precision requirements of the presentation. The development of the algorithm is achieved by treating equidistant generation as a locus-tracing problem. Using analytic concepts and the locus-defining geometric property, we formulate two sophisticated constructive operations. The repeated application of these operations generates a succession of points on the desired path (the locus) accurately and efficiently.
1	The effects of earthquake induced pore pressure on seismic and post seismic stability conditions of cohesionless slopes are investigated with reference to the infinite slope scheme. In cohesionless slopes the shear strength reduction caused by pore pressure build-up may lead the slope to a deformation failure or to a flow failure if liquefaction conditions are approached. Two critical values of the seismic induced pore pressure ratio are introduced to evaluate the effect of shear strength reduction on the slope failure mechanism. The results are given in the form of stability charts and a procedure for the evaluation of the seismic stability condition is described. The procedure gives useful information about the failure mechanism that slopes may exhibit and the displacement analysis which should be carried out.
1	Abstract   The Duffing oscillator under combined periodic and random excitations is investigated by a simple technique. The system response is separated into the deterministic and random parts governed by two coupled differential equations. The couple relation is expressed through varying on time coefficients which are approximately replaced by their averaging values over one period. This simplification yields that the two coupled differential equations can be solved by averaging and equivalent linearization methods. The mean-square response of the system is compared with the numerical results obtained by the finite element and Monte Carlo simulation methods. The results obtained show the interaction between the periodic and random excitations on the system response.
1	To evaluate failure probability of structures in the most general case is computationally demanding. The cost can be reduced by using the Response Surface Methodology, which builds a surrogate model of the target limit state function. In this paper authors consider a specific type of response surface, based on the Support Vector Method (SVM). Using the SVM the reliability problem is treated as a classification approach and extensive numerical experimentation has shown that each type of limit state can be adequately represented; however it could require a high number of sampling points. This work demonstrates that, by using a novel sampling strategy based on sampling directions, it is possible to obtain a good approximation of the limit state without high computational complexity. A second-order polynomial SVM model has been adopted, so the need of determining free parameters has been avoided. However, if needed, higher-order polynomial or Gaussian kernel can be adopted to approximate any kind of limit state. Some representative numerical examples show the accuracy and effectiveness of the presented procedure.
1	In this article a new fitness function is introduced in an attempt to improve the quality of the auto-regressive with exogenous inputs (ARX) model using a genetic algorithm (GA). The GA is employed to identify the coefficients and the number of time lags of the models of dynamic systems with the new fitness function which is based on the prediction error and the correlation functions between the prediction error and the input and output signals. The new fitness function provides the GA with a better performance in the evolution process. Two examples of the ARX modelling of a linear and a non-linear (NARX) simulated dynamic system are examined using the proposed fitness function.
1	Diss is a wild vegetal species which can be found in plenty on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea. This fibrous plant can provide cement materials with reinforcement properties similar to classical steel or polypropylene reinforced concrete. However, good adhesion between fibers and cement is required for the fibrous strengthening. The objective of this study is to investigate two types of treatments for Diss-based fibers in order to assess their efficiency. The first treatment consists of extracting the sugars by distillation of the Diss fibers. The second treatment consists of waterproofing the Diss fibers to prevent water absorption. The compressive and flexural strength parameters of Diss-cement composite are used to assess the treatment performances.
1	The ageing phenomenon and moisture damage become key factors to evaluate mixture cracking resistance. In this paper, the effect of ageing and water on cracking resistance and fatigue behavior in a bituminous mixture is studied. Specimens were tested by a direct tensile test (Fenix test) to obtain fracture energy values whereas variation of complex modulus and dissipated energy density was obtained by a strain sweep fatigue test (EBADE test). Results show a significant reduction in cracking resistance and fatigue life of the mixture after ageing (failure strain is reduced approximately by 35%). Water in standard conditions has very little influence.
0	Abstract   Among the thermal error sources of the high accuracy and efficiency machine tools, the thermal errors induced by the heat generated from running high speed motorized spindle is the crucial one. A new thermal error control method for motorized spindle is suggested, which is based on the thermal deformation balance principle. The essential idea of the method is to utilize the thermal contraction of Carbon Fiber Reinforced Plastic (CFRP) to restrain the thermal elongation of metal spindle housing. In the designed control system, the CFRP bars are uniformly distributed around the spindle housing, and the ThermoElectric Modules (TEMs) works as the heat pump which transfers the heat from spindle housing to CFRP bar. The experimental and numerical simulation results show that the suggested approach reduces 97% thermal displacement compared with the motorized spindle without the suggested thermal error control system. It is expected that the suggested method can also be applied to thermal error control for various cylindrical high-precision parts including aerospace equipment, optics and optical instruments.
1	We have to prepare the evaluation (fitness) function to evaluate the performance of the robot when we apply the machine learning techniques to the robot application. In many cases, the fitness function is composed of several aspects. Simple implementation to cope with the multiple fitness functions is a weighted summation. This paper presents an adaptive fitness function for the evolutionary computation to obtain the purposive behaviors through changing the weights for the fitness function. As an example task, a basic behavior in a simplified soccer game (shooting a ball into the opponent goal) is selected to show the validity of the adaptive fitness function. Simulation results and real experiments are shown, and a discussion is given. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.
1	Most of the robotic systems are designed to move and perform tasks in a variety of environments. Some of these environments are controllable and well-defined, and the tasks to be performed are generally everyday ones. However, exploration missions also enclose hard constraints such as driving vehicles to many locations in a surface of several kilometres to collect and/or analyse interesting samples. Therefore, a critical aspect for the mission is to optimally (or sub-optimally) plan the path that a robot should follow while performing scientific tasks. In this paper, we present up2ta, a new AI planner that interleaves path-planning and task-planning for mobile robotics applications. The planner is the result of integrating a modified PDDL planner with a path-planning algorithm, combining domain-independent heuristics and a domain-specific heuristic for path-planning. Then, up2ta can exploit capabilities of both planners to generate shorter paths while performing scientific tasks in an efficient ordered way. The planner has been tested in two domains: an exploration mission consisting of pictures acquisition, and a more challenging one that includes samples delivering. Also, up2ta has been integrated and tested in a real robotic platform for both domains. A planner for mobile robotics applications is proposed.Integrating task-planning and path-planning provides several advantages.Using specific and domain independent heuristics improves the solutions generated.
1	This paper presents an approach for developing a new consistency degree of two datasets, obtained from two different measuring systems on the same collection of items. In this approach, the concept of indiscernibility, frequently used in rough set approaches, is used to discover the classification consistency-based inclusion of one dataset to another. Next, in order to take into account the influence of neighboring relations of different data, we modify the previous index by proposing a fuzzy classification consistency-based inclusion degree. Also, the ordinal correlation between these two datasets, measured using a non-parametric method called Kendall's coefficient, is introduced. Finally, in order to create a reasonable integration of the previous two indices, a general consistency measure is constituted by introducing the expert knowledge into a fuzzy inference system. The overall procedure is believed to be capable of detecting nonlinear patterns lying beneath data while being safe to use a comparatively small number of experimental samples. Moreover, this new method can prevent the &quot;black box&quot; phenomenon encountered in many modeling techniques and produce robust and interpretable results. In practice, the proposed method is particularly significant for validating one measuring or evaluation system with respect to a standard reference. In order to validate the effectiveness of the proposed consistency degree, we apply it to study the relationship between tactile properties of a collection of fabric samples and their visual representations. The obtained results confirm that most of the tactile information can be perceived correctly by assessors through either video or image displays, while a better performance is detected in video scenarios.
0	Abstract   An attempt is made with X-ray triple crystal diffractometry to detect anisotropy of X-ray scattering by a structure consisting of a number of parallel dislocations, introduced into silicon by specially controlled sample deformation. Diffuse component scattering increased if the plane of scattering was perpendicular to the direction of dislocations ( ϕ =90°). The magnitude of this effect increases with increasing density of the introduced dislocations and depends on the direction of their Burgers vectors. The respective changes of the equal-intensity contours of X-ray scattering near reciprocal lattice points for the 111 reflection are investigated. The magnitudes of coherent and diffuse components of integral reflectivity were obtained experimentally. This yields quantitative information on the diffraction characteristics of structural perfection of the material. The dependencies of these characteristics are given, as well as of half-widths of a principal peak of a diffraction curve, on the angle of sample orientation relative to the X-ray beam  ϕ  and  ϑ  B . A comparison of appropriate data with those obtained for dislocation-free crystals of non-crucible zone melting silicon is carried out. The results obtained are discussed within the framework of existing theories of X-ray scattering and dislocation complexes.
0	The specific features of dynamic dissolution of iron oxides in metals (Fe, Ni, Cr, Zr, Ti and Al) under high-pressure compression shear at 300 K and their subsequent precipitation during thermal annealing were analyzed using Mossbauer spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction analysis, and transmission electron microscopy. Dissolution of iron oxides and formation of secondary oxides with matrix metals during deformation and subsequent annealing depended on the ability of metals to form solid solutions and chemical compounds with iron and oxygen. Formation of secondary oxides was accompanied by evolution of the surface of boundaries, providing conditions for formation of a nanocrystalline structure. It is shown that deformation-induced transport of oxygen atoms from iron oxides of low stability to the metal matrix is possible, and the formation of special oxides suitable for oxide dispersion-strengthening is demonstrated.
0	Abstract   Isothermal continuous and interrupted hot compression tests have been carried out on Gleeble-1500 system at temperatures of 300 °C and 400 °C, strain rates of 0.01 s −1  and 0.1 s −1 , respectively. The dynamic and static softening kinetics of 7150 aluminum alloy during multistage hot deformation were investigated by means of flow curves and relative softening rates. The results show that the flow curve exhibits a peak and some work softening during hot deformation of 7150 aluminum alloy. The flow stress increased with increasing strain rate and decreasing temperature while the flow softening decreased. The static softening increased with increasing strain rate, deformation temperature and delay time. The static softening curves appeared as a typical sigmoidal shape of the type at temperature of 400 °C, while plateaus were observed when temperature decreased to 300 °C. The appearance of static softening at 400 °C exceeding 100% was observed. An empirical static recrystallization model based on Johnson–Mehl–Avrami–Kolmogorov model with the recrystallization activation energy of 219.17 kJ/mol for 7150 aluminum alloy was derived.
0	Abstract   Dynamic and quasi-static compressions of porous copper and iron with cylindrical unidirectional pores were investigated at 298 and 77 K, with a focus on the effect of the interaction between the cylindrical pores and the deformation twins on the appearance of a plateau stress region in the stress–strain curves where the deformation proceeds at almost constant stress. The dynamic and quasi-static compressions were examined using the split Hopkinson pressure bar method and a universal testing machine, respectively. When porous copper undergoes dynamic (298 and 77 K) and quasi-static (298 K) compressions parallel to its cylindrical pores, the flow stresses increase monotonically with an increase in the strain. This is due to a homogeneous slip deformation originating from the high mobilities of the dislocations. However, when porous iron undergoes dynamic compression parallel to its pores at 298 K, macroscopically localized deformation bands analogous to bucking deformation occur, owing to the interaction between the oriented cylindrical pores and the deformation twins. This interaction acts as a trigger for the deformation band formation. As a result, the work hardening rate decreases drastically. Thus, in the case of dynamic parallel compression of porous iron at 298 K, a plateau stress region with a high stress (~300 MPa) and a wide strain range (of up to ~45%) appears. Because of this, the absorption of high-impact energy six times that can be absorbed by commercial aluminum foam with isotropic pores is achieved.
0	Abstract   In previous studies, the relationship between stacking fault energy (SFE) and the fatigue process has been examined under the fully reversed loading in which ratcheting does not occur. In this study, under the fully repeated loading, for pure Ni (128 mJ/m2), pure Cu (40 mJ/m2) and Cu–35 wt% Zn (11.5 mJ/m2) with different SFEs, the effect of fatigue damage and ratcheting damage on fatigue life was investigated. It was observed that for pure Ni, compared with pure Cu and Cu–35 wt% Zn, ratcheting damage is dominant. For Cu–35 wt% Zn, compared with pure Ni and pure Cu, fatigue damage is dominant. For pure Cu, both ratcheting damage and fatigue damage are dominant (mixed type). Thus, it was observed for the first time that high SFE tends to enhance ratcheting damage and low SFE tends to promote fatigue damage under the fully repeated loading.
0	Abstract   In this work, ultrafine-grained (UFG) copper alloys dispersed with nanoscale TiC particles were produced by combination of mechanical milling and spark plasma sintering (SPS). Microstructure evolution during uniaxial compression to height reduction of 20–60% in the temperature range of 400–700 °C was investigated systematically. The stress-strain curves in all conditions were characterized by a fast increase in stress at initial stage and a subsequent yield drop. No obvious microstructure change was observed with increasing reduction ratio. There exhibited a tendency in grain size refinement with increasing strain rate even the change in grain size is slight. A slight grain growth was found with the compression temperature high up to 700 °C. The high temperature tensile tests results suggested that the yield stress showed a relatively weak dependence on strain rate with a strain rate sensitivity parameter of around 0.02, and a low degree of strain hardening was observed. In addition, the recrystallization behavior was found to be inhibited by the ultrafine grains and nanoscale TiC particles in starting microstructure, because the grain boundaries or junctions in initial structure act as the severe pinning points, limiting bowing, and the nanoscale TiC particles prevent the nuclei formation of recrystallization. The fracture morphologies occurred during the tensile test were closely related to the change in particles distribution from random to aligned distribution during the hot press deformation.
1	The power required to operate large gyratory mills often exceeds 10 MW. Hence, optimisation of the power consumption will have a significant impact on the overall economic performance and environmental impact of the mineral processing plant. In most of the published models of tumbling mills (e.g. [Morrell, S., 1996. Power draw of wet tumbling mills and its relationship to charge dynamics, Part 2: An empirical approach to modelling of mill power draw. Trans. Inst. Mining Metall. (Section C: Mineral Processing Ext. Metall.) 105, C54-C62. Austin, L.G., 1990. A mill power equation for SAG mills. Miner. Metall. Process. 57-62]), the effect of lifter design and its interaction with mill speed and filling are not incorporated. Recent experience suggests that there is an opportunity for improving grinding efficiency by choosing the appropriate combination of these variables. However, it is difficult to experimentally determine the interactions of these variables in a full scale mill. Although some work has recently been published using DEM simulations, it was basically. limited to 2D. The discrete element code, Particle Flow Code 3D (PFC3D), has been used in this work to model the effects of lifter height (525 cm) and mill speed (50-90% of critical) on the power draw and frequency distribution of specific energy (J/kg) of normal impacts in a 5 m diameter autogenous (AG) mill. It was found that the distribution of the impact energy is affected by the number of lifters, lifter height, mill speed and mill filling. Interactions of lifter design, mill speed and mill filling are demonstrated through three dimensional distinct element methods (3D DEM) modelling. The intensity of the induced stresses (shear and normal) on lifters, and hence the lifter wear, is also simulated. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
1	In risky decision situations, many decision makers search for risk-defusing operators (RDOs). An RDO is an action intended by the decision maker to be performed additionally to a specific alternative and is expected to decrease the risk. Pre-event RDOs (e.g., vaccination) have to be applied before a negative event (e.g., infection) occurs. Post-event RDOs do not need to be initiated before and unless the event happens (e.g., medical treatment). For the successful application of Post-event RDOs, the negative event must be detected in time. Two experiments investigated the effect of uncertainty in the detection of the negative event. In Experiment 1, only a small minority of subjects noted this uncertainty without a cue, and even with cue, only a minority actively searched for probability information. In Experiment 2, the probability for correctly detecting the negative event was varied. When detection was certain, most subjects chose the alternative with a Post-event RDO, whereas this percentage decreased significantly with decreasing probability of correct detection. Also, in the conditions with a more extreme negative outcome, less decision makers chose the alternative with the Post-event RDO.
0	Abstract   The framework of thermodynamics of irreversible processes (TIP) enables the coherent formulation of constitutive equations for porous metal plasticity and viscoplasticity, expressions for the dissipated and stored energies, and a new form of the heat balance equation including void growth damage. These expressions are in good agreement with existing thermographic measurements, which provides additional confidence in the model. The linear stability analysis of a perturbation is applied to the whole set of equations. It gives some features of ductile fracture. Depending on the material parameters and on strain rate, shear localisation is induced by thermal softening, void growth damage, or a combination of both. Localisation is classically inhibited by inertia terms at very high strain rates, and postponed by viscosity. The combination of these phenomena creates an “adiabatic nose” in a strain–strain rate diagram. In the case of an axisymmetric stress tensor, that prevails for example in the centre of the necking zone of a round tensile specimen, a pure opening localisation can be obtained. The limitations of the analyses are mentioned.
0	Abstract   A versatile strategy for fabricating stretchable electronics involves controlled buckling of bridge structures in circuits that are configured into open, mesh layouts (i.e. islands connected by bridges) and bonded to elastomeric substrates. Quantitative analytical mechanics treatments of the responses of these bridges can be challenging, due to the range and diversity of possible motions.  Koiter (1945)  pointed out that the postbuckling analysis needs to account for all terms up to the 4th power of displacements in the potential energy. Existing postbuckling analyses, however, are accurate only to the 2nd power of displacements in the potential energy since they assume a linear displacement–curvature relation. Here, a systematic method is established for accurate postbuckling analysis of beams. This framework enables straightforward study of the complex buckling modes under arbitrary loading, such as lateral buckling of the island-bridge, mesh structure subject to shear (or twist) or diagonal stretching observed in experiments. Simple, analytical expressions are obtained for the critical load at the onset of buckling, and for the maximum bending, torsion (shear) and principal strains in the structure during postbuckling.
0	Abstract   A composite consisting of 30 vol.% MoSi2 particles in SiC matrix was prepared by liquid phase sintering carried out with the aid of small additions of Al2O3 and Y2O3 and then submitted to dry sliding tests using alumina as the counterfacing body under different conditions of applied load (15, 30 and 50 N) and relative speed (0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 m s−1), for a constant sliding distance of 10 km. Friction coefficient and system wear of the couple were continuously recorded during the tests. Phase composition and microstructure of the selected materials were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), optical microscopy (OM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) in the energy dispersion mode (EDS) and Vickers microhardness measurements (MHV). The surface finishing and roughness of the as-prepared materials were evaluated by means of stylus profilometry. Volume wear rates were determined by measuring the weight loss for the composite and the depth of wear track for alumina after each test. Moreover, wear debris were collected and then analyzed by means of XRD, SEM and Raman spectroscopy (RS). The effects of applied load and sliding speed on the wear rate and damage mechanisms were analyzed and discussed for both composite and alumina.
0	Nitrogen removal via nitrite, as opposed to the traditional nitrate, may be beneficial for carbon-limited biological wastewater treatment plants. However, reliable termination of nitrification at nitrite (nitritation) has proved difficult in the treatment of domestic wastewater. In this study, nitritation was attained in a sequencing batch reactor (SBR) with pre-denitrification treating domestic wastewater (total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) concentration of about 43 mgN L−1) by aerobic duration control. The aerobic duration control strategy terminates aeration upon completion of ammonium oxidation with accumulated nitrite still remaining. The SBR was purposefully operated such that the influence of other known selection factors for nitritation was absent. The process proved effective in achieving a steady state whereby over 80% nitritation was sustained. Investigation of the cause of nitritation by a calibrated ammonium and nitrite oxidation model showed aerobic duration control as the key factor leading to nitritation.
1	Abstract   Spark ignition in lean and highly turbulent premixed flows is experimentally investigated by measuring the Minimum Ignition Energy (MIE), for laser-induced spark ignition in methane/air mixtures, as a function of the velocity fluctuation      u    ′     , the equivalence ratio and the focal length of the focusing lens. The burner provides a 2D stationary flow with a homogeneous and isotropic turbulence.  A clear transition on the MIE values is observed, when      u    ′      increases. Before the transition, the MIE increases gradually with      u    ′     , whereas across the transition (for      u    ′    ∼  1    m      s    −  1     ), the MIE increases strongly. As the MIE is proportional to the flame thickness to the power of three, this slope breakdown could indicate the existence of two distinct modes of flame structure. From a certain threshold of turbulence intensity, the flame kernel no longer develops in a flamelet regime, rather in a regime where its structure is strongly modified by the turbulence: the flame front would undergo an intense mixing by all the eddies of the flow (    Da     1   ) and a thickening by the small eddies (    Ka   ∼  10   ), leading to an intense stretch and possibly local extinctions. This ignition transition phenomenon in turbulent mixtures has already been reported by Shy et al. (2010)  [1]  and Huang et al. (2007)  [2] , but for different experimental conditions.  The present study also reveals that there is a common criterion for the ignition transition phenomenon: whatever the focal length of the focusing lens and the equivalence ratio of the mixture, an ignition transition occurs when the turbulent flow reaches a Karlovitz number of the order of 10.
0	Abstract   The flow stress behavior of OFHC polycrystalline copper was evaluated using cold-rolled and equal channel angular extruded materials. Prior to tensile testing at room temperature, the specimens were heat treated to obtain grain sizes ranging from 3 to 60 μm. The flow stress, when correlated with the square root of true strain, is associated with four stages of hardening. These stages, in terms of increasing strain, are attributed to: (1) dislocation source activation, possibly at annealing twin boundaries during the onset of plastic flow, (2) dislocation slip and cross slip, (3) constriction of the screw dislocation partials for cross slip continuation, and (4) dislocation annihilation and saturation as interpreted through dynamic recovery. The tensile properties and analyses are supported by observations and measurements from orientation imaging and transmission electron microscopy.
0	Abstract   Anodic aluminum oxide with a nano-honeycomb structure is subjected to nanoindentation along the axial direction of the honeycomb. The load–displacement behavior is discontinuous with periodic strain excursions. Top-view and cross-sectional microscopic examination reveals a localized mode of deformation with very clear-cut elastoplastic boundaries. A crack system that is self-similar with respect to the indent size is also found, and this is thought to correspond to the discontinuous load–displacement behavior. A simple column model is proposed to explain certain features of the deformation microstructure.
0	Abstract   This article reports the first investigations of CuIn1−xGaxSe2 (CIGSe) polycrystalline thin films by means of atom probe tomography. Attention is focused on the distribution of Na atoms within the films. Both Na-containing and Na-free CIGSe thin films have been investigated. When Na is available during the CIGSe coevaporation, it is observed to be mainly segregated at the grain boundaries of the films; however, it is also detected within the grains of CIGSe at very low concentration.
0	Abstract   We identify the role of deformation twinning and twin–twin intersections on the strain hardening behavior of Hadfield steel single crystals using strain field measurements. In situ and ex situ strain field measurements resolved at micrometer length scales are obtained using digital image correlation. Ex situ measurements reveal that macroscopic twin-bands, which are composed of a mixture of fine twin-lamella and matrix material, generate approximately 30% axial strain. This measurement is comparable to strain predictions based on twinning crystallography. In situ measurements reveal that primary and secondary twins may nucleate simultaneously, but the primary twin-system remains predominantly active with increased deformation. The intersection of primary and secondary twin-systems was directly linked to an increase in the strain hardening response.
0	Abstract   The piezospectroscopic (PS) properties of chromium-doped alumina allow for embedded inclusion mechanics to be revisited with unique experimental setups that probe the particles’ state of stress when the composite is under applied load. These experimental investigations of particle mechanics will be compared to the Eshelby theory and a derivative theory. This work discovers that simple nanoparticle load transfer theories are adequate for predicting PS properties in the low to intermediate volume fraction range (⩽20%). By applying the multiscale mechanics to a PS response, the inverse problem was demonstrated to reveal the elastic modulus of the composite. The implications for this technique are damage monitoring through observation of reduced mechanical properties in addition to a method to assist with engineering nanomaterials.
1	Abstract   Large Volume Metrology (LVM) tasks can require the concurrent use of several measuring systems. These systems generally consist of set of sensors measuring the distances and/or angles with respect to a point of interest so as to determine its 3D position. When combining different measuring systems, characterized by sensors of different nature, competitive or cooperative methods can be adopted for fusing data. Competitive methods, which are by far the most diffused in LVM, basically perform a weighted mean of the 3D positions determined by the individual measuring systems. On the other hand, for cooperative methods, distance and/or angular measurements by sensors of different systems are combined together in order to determine a unique 3D position of the point of interest.  This paper proposes a novel cooperative approach which takes account of the measurement uncertainty in distance and angular measurements of sensors of different nature. The proposed approach is compared with classical competitive approaches from the viewpoint of the metrological performance. The main advantages of the cooperative approach, with respect to the competitive one, are: (i) it is the only option when the individual LVM systems are not able to provide autonomous position measurements (e.g., laser interferometers or single cameras), (ii) it is the only option when only some of the sensors of autonomous systems work correctly (for instance, a laser tracker in which only distance – not angular – measurements are performed), (iii) when using systems with redundant sensors (i.e. photogrammetric systems with a large number of distributed cameras), point localization tends to be better than that using the competitive fusion approach.
1	Abstract   Usability evaluation is now considered an essential procedure in consumer product development. Many studies have been conducted to develop various techniques and methods of usability evaluation hoping to help the evaluators choose appropriate methods. However, planning and conducting usability evaluation requires considerations of a number of factors surrounding the evaluation process including the product, user, activity, and environmental characteristics. In this perspective, this study suggested a new methodology of usability evaluation through a simple, structured framework. The framework was outlined by three major components: the interface features of a product as design variables, the evaluation context consisting of user, product, activity, and environment as context variables, and the usability measures as dependent variables. Based on this framework, this study established methods to specify the product interface features, to define evaluation context, and to measure usability. The effectiveness of this methodology was demonstrated through case studies in which the usability of audiovisual products was evaluated by using the methods developed in this study. This study is expected to help the usability practitioners in consumer electronics industry in various ways. Most directly, it supports the evaluators’ plan and conduct usability evaluation sessions in a systematic and structured manner. In addition, it can be applied to other categories of consumer products (such as appliances, automobiles, communication devices, etc.) with minor modifications as necessary.
1	Abstract   Designing products to satisfy customers’ emotion requires the information gathered through the human senses, which are visual, auditory, olfactory, gustatory, or tactile senses. By controlling certain design factors, customers’ emotion can be evaluated, designed, and satisfied. In this study, a systematic approach is proposed to study the tactile sense regarding the surface roughness. Numerous pairs of antonymous tactile adjectives are collected and clustered. The optimal number of adjective clusters is estimated based on the several criterion functions. The representative average preferences of the final clusters are obtained as the estimates of engineering parameters to control the surface roughness of the commercial polymer-based products.
1	Abstract   Many of today’s underground utilities are reaching the end of their practical life and need to be replaced or repaired. At the same time, new utility installations due to urban expansion and development of new communication technologies such as broadband are in progress. Hence accurate information of these utilities is essential for utility owners, engineers, contractors or surveyors, particularly as reference for excavation. Ground penetrating radar has been widely used in extracting information of buried utilities for better utility maintenance and management. The widely used scanning technique (i.e. ‘perpendicular-to-pipe’ scanning) is limited for retrieving the precise position of targets due to the effects of surrounding media. This paper provides a solution for the prevention of failed excavations by means of precise underground utility mapping. This paper first of all examines the accuracy of the commonly used data acquisition scanning technique, by conduction a series of tests, and then developed a better method. Subsequently, a real-life experiment was carried out to validate the performance of the proposed new scanning technique, to demonstrate its accuracy and effectiveness. We found that our method was able to do ‘along-pipe’ scanning with very high precision (i.e. less than +0.10 m, conforming to Quality Level A utility data). Hence, the proposed method set as a new benchmark for using ground penetrating radar for precisely locating buried utilities.
1	Abstract   An acid cleavable lipid (SA-3M) was synthesized and used to develop pH-responsive solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) to deliver vancomycin base (VM-FB) to acidic infection sites. The size, polydispersity index and zeta potential of VM-FB_SA-3M_SLNs were 132.9 ± 9.1 nm, 0.159 ± 0.01 and −26 ± 4.4 mV respectively, with 57.80 ± 1.1% encapsulation efficiency. VM-FB release was significantly faster at pH 6.5 than pH 7.4. In vitro antibacterial activity against methicillin-susceptible and resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA and MRSA) revealed that SLNs had enhanced activity at pH 6.5 than pH 7.4. In vivo study showed that the amount of MRSA remaining in the skin of VM-FB_SA-3M_SLNs treated mice was approximately 22-fold lower than VM-FB treated mice. Histological investigations revealed that signs of inflammation in the skin treated with VM-FB_SA-3M_SLNs were minimal. In conclusion, this study confirmed that SA-3M can form pH-responsive SLNs capable of releasing antibiotic specifically at acidic infection sites.
0	Abstract   Bias temperature instability (BTI) is one of the critical device degradation mechanisms in poly-Si/SiON and metal gate/high- k  complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technologies. Using the pre- and post-BTI flicker noise measurements, we investigated the bulk trap density, N t,  in both of these technologies. The low-frequency noise spectra were predominantly of 1/f γ  type with γ  TH  degradation due to PBTI was noticed while considerable V TH  degradation was observed for NBTI in both SiON and MGHK technologies. Both MGHK and SiON pFETs show a clear increase in the effective volume trap density, N t , after NBTI. The increase in N t  in MGHK n-MOSFETs during PBTI is markedly higher than that in MGHK p-MOSFETs during NBTI.
1	An improved high voltage LDMOSFET with multiple-resistivity drift region is proposed. Using the 2-D process simulator TSUPREM4 and device simulator MEDICI, we design a conventional LDMOSFET optimized for breakdown voltage. Then multiple-resistivity drift region is incorporated, with optimized thickness and doping concentration to reduce specific on-resistance while the breakdown voltage is not degraded. To further improve the device performance, we apply a field plate above the drift region to attract more electrons. Carrier concentration in the channel is increased, so drain current level is improved. The simulation result shows that the optimized complex structure, containing both multiple-resistivity drift region and a field plate, exhibits a 34.2% reduction in specific on-resistance with a mere 2.5% degradation of breakdown voltage compared to the standard LDMOSFET.
1	Abstract   Based on the octet formalism established by the authors, Green’s functions for an infinite anisotropic elastic thin plate with a Griffith crack or an anticrack (rigid line inclusion) are studied. The plate can be laminated or consist of a continuously inhomogeneous material in the thickness direction. Two systems of problems of the plate under non-self-equilibrated loads are solved. The first is associated with discontinuous in-plane displacements and slopes, in-plane concentrated forces and out-of-plane concentrated moments. The second is associated with a transverse concentrated force. The Green functions for an infinite plate with a crack or an anticrack and the surface Green functions for an infinite plate with a crack are obtained in an exact closed form. The surface Green functions and associated stress resultants at any point throughout the line where the crack is located are presented in a real form. The intensity factor of membrane stress resultants and bending moments are obtained in a real form for the Griffith crack subjected to concentrated loads.
0	Abstract   The present work is a theoretical investigation of the applicability of magnetic fields for controlling hydrodynamic separation in Jeffrey-Hamel flows of viscoelastic fluids. To achieve this goal, a local similarity solution was found for laminar, two-dimensional flow of a viscoelastic fluid obeying second-order/second-grade model as its constitutive equation with the assumption being made that the flow is symmetric and purely radial. These assumptions enabled a third-order nonlinear ODE to be obtained as the single equation governing the MHD flow of this particular fluid in flow through converging/diverging channels. With three physical boundary conditions available, Chebyshev collocation-point method was used to solve this ODE numerically. Results are presented in terms of parameters such as Reynolds number, Weissenberg number, channel half-angle, and the magnetic number. It was found that these parameters all have a profound effect on the velocity profiles in Jeffrey-Hamel flows. The effect of magnetic field was found to be more striking in that it is predicted to force fluid elements near the wall to exceed centerline velocity in converging channels and to suppress separation in diverging channels. Interestingly, the effect of the magnetic field in delaying flow separation is predicted to become more pronounced the higher the fluid’s elasticity.
1	The inversion of an ill-conditioned matrix of measured data lies at the heart of procedures for the quantification of structure-borne sources and transmission paths. In an earlier paper the use of over-determination, singular value decomposition and the rejection of small singular values was discussed. In the present paper alternative techniques for regularizing the matrix inversion are considered. Such techniques have been used in the field of digital image processing and more recently in relation to nearfield acoustic holography. The application to structure-borne sound transmission involves matrices, which vary much more with frequency and from one element to another. In this study Tikhonov regularization is used with the ordinary cross-validation method for selecting the regularization parameter. An iterative inversion technique is also studied. Here a form of cross-validation is developed allowing an optimum value of the iteration parameter to be selected. Simulations are carried out using a rectangular plate structure to assess the relative merits of these techniques. Experiments are also performed to validate the results. Both techniques are found to give considerably improved results compared to singular value rejection.
1	Abstract   A two-dimensional analytical model is developed to describe the free extensional vibrations of thin elastic plates of elliptical planform with or without a confocal cutout under general elastically restrained edge conditions, based on the Navier displacement equation of motion for a state of plane stress. The model has been simplified by invoking the Helmholtz decomposition theorem, and the method of separation of variables in elliptic coordinates is used to solve the resulting uncoupled governing equations in terms of products of (even and odd) angular and radial Mathieu functions. Extensive numerical results are presented in an orderly fashion for the first three anti-symmetric/symmetric natural frequencies of elliptical plates of selected geometries under different combinations of classical (clamped and free) and flexible boundary conditions. Also, the occurrences of “frequency veering” between various modes of the same symmetry group and interchange of the associated mode shapes in the veering region are noted and discussed. Moreover, selected 2D deformed mode shapes are presented in vivid graphical form. The accuracy of solutions is checked through appropriate convergence studies, and the validity of results is established with the aid of a commercial finite element package as well as by comparison with the data in the existing literature. The set of data reported herein is believed to be the first rigorous attempt to obtain the in-plane vibration frequencies of solid and annular thin elastic elliptical plates for a wide range of plate eccentricities.
0	Abstract   In the current work we develop a thermo-mechanically consistent model describing the behavior of thin polymeric films. In industrial applications of such thin films, e.g. in bonding metal sheets in automotive industry, boundary layers and, as a further result, scale effects depending on the thickness of the film are observed (see e.g. [ Toney et al., 1995 ;  Frank et al., 1996 ; J. Polym. Sci., Part B: Polym. Phys. 40 (2001) 2343–2353]). In contrast to the well-analyzed size effects in many other micro-structured materials, e.g. granular materials, porous materials or foams (see e.g. [Int. J. Mech. Sci. 43 (2001) 701–713] or [Proc. R. Soc. London A 458 (2002) 2869–2883]), the macroscopic behavior of the former material differs completely from an experimental point of view. In the analyzed polymeric films a weaker zone at the boundary of the film is observed in comparison with the stiffer material behavior of the bulk material. To capture these and more general types of boundary layer effects, we develop an extended continuum model based on a scalar-valued order parameter following the line of [Continua with Microstructures. Vol. 35 of Springer Tracts in Natural Philosophy. Springer, New York, 1980; Meccanica 17 (1982) 80–84; Ann. Mater. Pura Appl. 135 (1983) 1–25; Continuum Mech. Thermodyn. 4 (1999) 247–262].
1	Abstract   This paper studies the propagation of a plane-strain fluid-driven fracture with a fluid lag in an elastic solid. The fracture is driven by a constant rate of injection of an incompressible viscous fluid at the fracture inlet. The leak-off of the fracturing fluid into the host solid is considered negligible. The viscous fluid flow is lagging behind an advancing fracture tip, and the resulting tip cavity is assumed to be filled at some specified low pressure with either fluid vapor (impermeable host solid) or pore-fluids infiltrating from the permeable host solid. The scaling analysis allows to reduce problem parametric space to two lumped dimensionless parameters with the meaning of the solid toughness and of the tip underpressure (difference between the specified pressure in the tip cavity and the far field confining stress). A constant lumped toughness parameter uniquely defines solution trajectory in the parametric space, while time-varying lumped tip underpressure parameter describes evolution along the trajectory. Further analysis identifies the early and large time asymptotic states of the fracture evolution as corresponding to the small and large tip underpressure solutions, respectively. The former solution is obtained numerically herein and is characterized by a maximum fluid lag (as a fraction of the crack length), while the latter corresponds to the zero-lag solution of Spence and Sharp [Spence, D.A., Sharp, P.W., 1985. Self-similar solution for elastohydrodynamic cavity flow. Proc. Roy. Soc. London, Ser. A (400), 289–313]. The self-similarity at small/large tip underpressure implies that the solution for crack length, crack opening and net fluid pressure in the fluid-filled part of the crack is a given power-law of time, while the fluid lag is a constant fraction of the increasing fracture length. Evolution of a fluid-driven fracture between the two limit states corresponds to gradual expansion of the fluid-filled region and disappearance of the fluid lag. For small solid toughness and small tip underpressure, the fracture is practically devoid of fluid, which is localized into a narrow region near the fracture inlet. Corresponding asymptotic solution on the fracture lengthscale corresponds to that of a crack loaded by a pair of point forces which magnitude is determined from the coupled hydromechanical solution in the fluid-filled region near the crack inlet. For large solid toughness, the fluid lag is vanishingly small at any underpressure and the solution is adequately approximated by the zero-lag self-similar large toughness solution at any stage of fracture evolution. The small underpressure asymptotic solutions obtained in this work are sought to provide initial condition for the propagation of fractures which are initially under plane-strain conditions.
0	A new technique is presented for evaluating the effective properties of linearly elastic, multi-phase unidirectional composites. Various effects on the fiber/matrix interfaces (perfect bond, homogeneously imperfect interfaces, uniform interphase layers) are allowed. The analysis of nano-composite materials based on the Gurtin and Murdoch model of material surface is also included. The basic idea of the approach is to construct a circular inhomogeneity in an infinite plane whose effects on the displacements and stresses at distant points are the same as those of a finite cluster of inhomogeneities (fibers of circular cross-section) arranged in a pattern representative of the composite material in question. The elastic properties of the equivalent inhomogeneity then define the effective elastic properties of the material. The volume ratio of the composite material is found after the size of the equivalent circular inhomogeneity is defined in the course of the solution procedure. This procedure is based on a semi-analytical solution of a problem of an infinite plane containing a cluster of non-overlapping circular inhomogeneities subjected to loading at infinity. The method works equally well for periodic and random composites and – importantly – eliminates the necessity for averaging either stresses or strains. New results for nano-composite materials are presented.
1	Biological and manmade structures often share the same specifications and design constraints: structural support, lightweight or protection against specific threats. In this context, the structure of fishscales, consisting of small rigid plates growing out of the skin of a majority of fish species, are characterized by a large variety of shape, size and properties in order to achieve particular functions. The present study introduces a basic two-dimensional micromechanical model that permits to establish a correlation between the flexural response of a scaled skin and the nature of its underlying structure, including both geometric and material aspects. The model is used to predict trends in the structure’s response and illustrates the fact that the scale design, arrangement and properties can be tailored to achieve a wide spectrum of response. In particular, fishscale structure possesses an inherent strain-stiffening response that can be suppressed or magnified by certain structural features. This particularity, shared by most biological materials, ensures that the structure provides both a structural and protective support for the animal. 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
1	Abstract   In this study, we present a method of numerical homogenization, combining asymptotic analysis and finite element modelling, to establish constitutive laws of heterogeneous materials with periodic microstructures tacking into account high-order strain gradients. By performing asymptotic analysis, the problem of local homogenization was split up into differential equations of different orders, which were solved using finite element modelling. This approach allows researcher to accurately calculate high-order stiffness tensors from representative volume elements (RVEs) with complicated microstructures and geometrical forms. The efficiency and accuracy of this approach were verified by means of numerical examples. The mechanical implications, consistency, and strain energy convexity of the strain gradient constitutive laws, obtained using the proposed approach, are analyzed on the basis of the numerical results.
1	Abstract   Loudness as a subjective measurement and acceleration as an objective measurement were taken to measure the frequency characteristics of four different bone conduction actuators. The loudness of bone conduction was measured by balancing bone-conducted stimuli at 17 frequencies from 0.2 kHz to 8 kHz. The acceleration at equal loudness, which was measured by a Bruel &amp; Kjaer 4930 artificial mastoid, was transferred to relative levels for comparison with the loudness measurements. A relationship between loudness and acceleration was difficult to find for a bone conduction actuator of inner-ear type while for a head-of-mandible type, a relationship was found at some frequencies. Furthermore, otoacoustic emission of a head-of-mandible actuator was measured. It was hypothesized that loudness can be estimated by objective measurements of bone conduction actuators at specific frequencies.
1	We deal with a complex game between Alice and Bob where each contender's probability of victory grows monotonically by unknown amounts with the resources employed. For a fixed effort on Alice's part, Bob increases his resources on the basis of the results for each round (victory, tie or defeat) with the aim of reducing the probability of defeat to below a given threshold. We read this goal in terms of computing a confidence interval for the probability of losing and realize that the moves in some contests may bring in an indeterminacy trap: in certain games Bob cannot simultaneously have both a low probability-of-defeat measure and a narrow confidence interval. We use the inferential mechanism called twisting argument to compute the above interval on the basis of two joint statistics. Careful use of such statistics allows us to avoid indeterminacy.
0	Abstract   The proton location and dynamics in the ionic divalent metal hydroxides has been investigated using the technique of muon spin relaxation (μSR). Implanted positive muons behave as a light isotope of hydrogen, and an analysis of the zero field μSR relaxation has provided an unambiguous assignment of the muon site in these materials: the muon takes up a proton vacancy, probably by binding to a deprotonated O 2−  ion. Relaxation measurements in the temperature regime immediately prior to dehydration suggest the presence of localised proton dynamics that persists to the onset of dehydration.
1	A series of novel alkyltriazole tagged pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine derivatives 5 and 6 was prepared starting from 2,3-active functional pyridine 1 via cyclization, propargylation followed by reaction with alkyl or perfluoroalkyl azides under Sharpless conditions. All the compounds 5 and 6 were screened for anticancer activity against three cancer cell lines such as U937, THP-1 and Colo205. The promising compounds 5b and 5e have been identified.
0	Abstract   Graphene poly-acrylic and PEDOT:PSS nanocomposite films were produced using two alternative commercial graphene powders to explore how the graphene flake dimensions and chemical composition affected the electrical performance of the film. A range of analytical techniques, including scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS), were employed to systematically analyse the initial graphene materials as well as the nanocomposite films. Electrical measurements indicated that the sheet resistance of the films was affected by the properties of the graphene flakes used. To further explore the composition of the films, ToF-SIMS mapping was employed and provided a direct means to elucidate the nature of the graphene dispersion in the films and to correlate this with the electrical analysis. These results reveal important implications for how the dispersion of the graphene material in films produced from printable inks can be affected by the type of graphene powder used and the corresponding effect on electrical performance of the nanocomposites. This work provides direct evidence for how accurate and comparable characterisation of the graphene material is required for real-world graphene materials to develop graphene enabled films and proposes a measurement protocol for comparing graphene materials that can be used for international standardisation.
0	Abstract   Hong Kong has practiced seawater toilet flushing since 1958, saving 750,000 m3 of freshwater every day. A high sulfate-to-COD ratio (&gt;1.25 mg       SO   4   2  −      /mg COD) in the saline sewage resulting from this practice has enabled us to develop the  S ulfate reduction,  A utotrophic denitrification and  N itrification  I ntegrated (SANI®) process with minimal sludge production and oxygen demand. Recently, the SANI® process has been expanded to include Enhanced Biological Phosphorus Removal (EBPR) in an alternating anaerobic/limited-oxygen (LOS-EBPR) aerobic sequencing batch reactor (SBR). This paper presents further development – an anaerobic/anoxic denitrifying sulfur cycle-associated EBPR, named as DS-EBPR, bioprocess in an alternating anaerobic/anoxic SBR for simultaneous removal of organics, nitrogen and phosphorus. The 211 day SBR operation confirmed the sulfur cycle-associated biological phosphorus uptake utilizing nitrate as electron acceptor. This new bioprocess cannot only reduce operation time but also enhance volumetric loading of SBR compared with the LOS-EBPR. The DS-EBPR process performed well at high temperatures of 30 °C and a high salinity of 20% seawater. A synergistic relationship may exist between sulfur cycle and biological phosphorus removal as the optimal ratio of P-release to       SO   4   2  −      -reduction is close to 1.0 mg P/mg S. There were no conventional PAOs in the sludge.
1	Abstract   The hydrostatic pressure (P) influence of the degenerate energy states inside an inverse parabolic quantum dot (IPQD), with and without an external magnetic field, was performed within the frame of the effective mass approximation. Our theoretical results showed that the effect of relatively high pressure clearly appeared to induce a crossing between the excited states in the strong confinement region. But in the weak confinement region, such crossing disappeared and, in addition, the excited states got reordered. In the presence of an external magnetic field the hydrostatic pressure modified the crossing points of the degenerate states. We investigated the electron-heavy hole transition energy. It displayed a blue shift with increasing the pressure values and the magnetic field strength. But it showed an adhesive red shift by increasing the IPQD size.
1	Abstract   The mechanical performance and electrochemical stability in simulated body fluid (SBF) of a lightweight Fe-30Mn-10Al-1C (in wt.%) alloy after gas nitridation were investigated. The gas nitriding process was performed at 550 °C for 5 h under pure NH3 atmosphere. The nitrided layer was ∼45 μm-thick and consisted predominantly of fine AlN. The surface microhardness, ultimate tensile strength, yield strength, and elongation of the present gas-nitrided alloy are 1814 Hv, 1078 MPa, 1024 MPa, and 77%, respectively. The corrosion tests in SBF showed that the gas-nitrided alloy exhibited a corrosion current density (Icorr) of 5.0 × 10−9 A/cm2, a pitting corrosion current density (Ipit) of 5.1 × 10−7 A/cm2, and a passivation region with ΔE (≡Ep − Ecorr) ≈ +1804 mV, respectively, which are substantially better than those obtained in the plasma-nitrided and hydroxyapatite-coated 316L stainless steel. The results demonstrated that the present gas-nitrided alloy having an excellent combination of strength, ductility and corrosion resistance is a promising candidate to replace 316L stainless steel for medical implants.
0	Abstract   This study demonstrates that, PEO-acrylates composite containing graphene oxide (GO) can be easily 3D printed from water based formulations. Exploiting the good water affinity of graphene oxide, the filler can be easily dispersed in oligomers formulations and printed by using a low cost DLP equipment. Then the UV post curing process, which is always mandatory after a DLP process, is exploited to in situ reduce the graphene oxide embedded in the matrix; similarly a thermal treatment is also investigated as post process. Different 3D structures are submitted to the reduction post-treatments and the influence of the UV and thermal reduction on the mechanical and electrical properties of the printed objects is investigated. The present work shows the possibility to easily produce 3D shaped GO-based composites whose final properties can be tailored trough a UV or thermal post process performed on the printed parts that induces the in situ reduction of GO embedded in the polymer matrix.
0	Abstract   Using first-principles calculations, the hydrogen storage capacity of bimetal alloy nanostructures has been carried out. We select two stable structures, Al 10 Li 8  and Al 13 Li 20 , as paradigms, where Li atoms are exposed and unsaturated on the surfaces of Al clusters. The advantages of these structures are: (1) Li atoms do not cluster on the surfaces of Al nanoclusters. (2) Al 10  and Al 13  are much lighter than previous studied systems C 60  and C 48 B 12 . (3) Both Al 10 Li 8  and Al 13  are very stable magic clusters. We show that in these two systems each exposed Li atom is able to bind one H 2  molecule. The average binding energies are 0.10 and 0.13 eV/H 2 , with gravimetric densities of 4.1 wt% and 7.5 wt%, respectively, nearly meet and exceed the requirement of 5.5 wt% set by DOE.
0	Abstract   In this study, a magnetic infinite coordination polymer with the morphology of nanocapsule, as an efficient adsorbent for removal of Hg2+ ions has been introduced. This infinite coordination polymer was synthesized from Zn2+ ion and a ditopic organic ligand (1,3-bis(tetrazol-5-ylmethyl)benzene (btb)) and its efficiency as an adsorbent was studied in view of adsorption isotherms, kinetics and thermodynamics. The adsorption capacity of mercury(II) ions was impressed by pH value and adsorption time and the optimal adsorption conditions were pH value of 8, adsorption time of 75 min. The adsorption isotherm was analyzed by Freundlich and Langmuir equations and was fitted with Langmuir model better. Outcomes indicated that the adsorption was an endothermic process. Moreover, this adsorption process was fitted with pseudo-second order model kinetically. Finally, the magnetic properties of nanocapsules synthesized in high and low concentration of initial reagents were investigated. Studies showed that the saturation magnetization of nanocapsules synthesized in low concentration of initial reagent is higher.
0	Abstract   Rolled-up fiber scrolls with outer omnidirectional porous and inner hierarchical porous structure have been fabricated as electrodes of fiber-shaped supercapacitors (FSCs) by polymerizing polyaniline (PANi) nanopillars onto hierarchical 3D interconnected porous N-doped carbon nanofibers scrolls (PANi-HCNFs). The as-prepared fiber-shaped PANi-HCNFs electrode materials used for all solid-state FSCs display excellent electrochemical performance with a high specific capacitance of 339.3 F g−1 (85.1 mF cm−1) and specific mass energy density of 11.6 Wh kg−1 (areal energy density of 4.28 μWh cm−2). Meanwhile, PANi-HCNFs show good cycling stability with capacity retention of 74.2% after 3000 cycles at 0.5 A g−1. The superior electrochemical performance can be attributed to the combining of PANi nanopillars array on the 3D interconnected conducting network with the outer omnidirectional porous and inner hierarchical porous composite structure. This unique composite structure can provide high specific surface area, enabling the effective transport of electrolyte to the inner region of the composite fiber. The backbones of N-doped carbon nanofibers form abundant interconnected conductive network and offer multiple electronic transfer paths. Meanwhile, introducing nanostructured PANi nanopillars array into the carbon matrix can improve higher energy density and provide better cycling stability.
1	The stability and longevity of recordings obtained from intracortical microelectrodes continues to remain an area of concern for neural interfacing applications. The limited longevity of microelectrode performance has been associated with the integrity of the blood brain barrier (BBB) and the neuroinflammatory response to the microelectrode. Here, we report the investigation of an additive approach that targets both mechanical and chemical factors believed to contribute to chronic BBB instability and the neuroinflammatory response associated with implanted intracortical microelectrodes. The implants investigated were based on a mechanically adaptive, compliant nanocomposite (NC), which reduces the tissue response and tissue strain. This material was doped with various concentrations of the antioxidant resveratrol with the objective of local and rapid delivery. In vitro analysis of resveratrol release, antioxidant activity, and cytotoxicity suggested that a resveratrol content of 0.01% was optimal for in vivo assessment. Thus, probes made from the neat NC reference and probes containing resveratrol (NC Res) were implanted into the cortical tissue of rats for up to sixteen weeks. Histochemical analysis suggested that at three days post-implantation, neither materials nor therapeutic approaches (independently or in combination) could alter the initial wound healing response. However, at two weeks post-implantation, the NC Res implant showed a reduction in activated microglia/macrophages and improvement in neuron density at the tissue-implant interface when compared to the neat NC reference. However, sixteen weeks post-implantation, when the antioxidant was exhausted, NC Res and the neat NC reference exhibited similar tissue responses. The data show that NC Res provides short-term, short-lived benefits due to the antioxidant release, and a long-term reduction in neuroinflammation on account of is mechanical adaptive, compliant nature. Together, these results demonstrate that local delivery of resveratrol can provide an additive advantage by providing a consistent reduction in the tissue response.
0	Silver (Ag)-based materials are widely used as effective antibacterial agents for a wide spectrum of bacteria. There is a great challenge to reduce the amount of Ag in Ag-based materials without limiting its antibacterial activity. Herein, the Ag-zeolite NaY (50% from its cation exchange capacity) was functionalized with 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane to produce an amine functionalized, Ag-zeolite NaY. The results showed that the functionalization of Ag-zeolite NaY improved its antibacterial activity against a wide spectrum of bacteria (Escherichia coli ATCC11229 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC6538), especially in solutions containing electrolyte (saline solution), although it has a lower surface area, pore volume and amount of Ag released compared to those of zeolite NaY and Ag-zeolite NaY. Thus, the functionalization of Ag-based materials is a promising approach to reducing the amount of Ag required in Ag-based material while improving its antibacterial activity.
0	Abstract   Precursors of failure are dislocation mechanisms at the nanoscale and dislocation organization at the mesoscale responsible for long-range internal stresses and lattice rotation. Detailed information on the link between both scales is missing, computationally and experimentally. Here we present a method based on x-ray Laue diffraction scanning providing time and sub-micron spatially resolved evolution of geometrical necessary dislocations in volumes that are similar to what advanced computational models can achieve. The approach is used to follow dislocation patterning during accumulation of fatigue cycles using a newly developed miniaturized shear device. Performed on Cu during cyclic shear, it reveals early dislocation patterning influenced by pre-existing dislocation structures. The quantitative information on non-homogeneous structure formation and its evolution corresponds to the need for synergies with continuum dislocation plasticity simulations of fatigue or any other type of plastic deformation.
1	Abstract   Microstructure characterization and reconstruction have become indispensable parts of computational materials science. The main contribution of this paper is to introduce a general methodology for practical and efficient characterization and reconstruction of stochastic microstructures based on supervised learning. The methodology is general in that it can be applied to a broad range of microstructures (clustered, porous, and anisotropic). By treating the digitized microstructure image as a set of training data, we generically learn the stochastic nature of the microstructure via fitting a supervised learning model to it (we focus on classification trees). The fitted supervised learning model provides an implicit characterization of the joint distribution of the collection of pixel phases in the image. Based on this characterization, we propose two different approaches to efficiently reconstruct any number of statistically equivalent microstructure samples. We test the approach on five examples and show that the spatial dependencies within the microstructures are well preserved, as evaluated via correlation and lineal-path functions. The main advantages of our approach stem from having a compact empirically-learned model that characterizes the stochastic nature of the microstructure, which not only makes reconstruction more computationally efficient than existing methods, but also provides insight into morphological complexity.
0	Abstract   ESR measurements have been performed in the linear chain entiferromagnet RbFeS2 in the temperature range 100–380 K. Both the resonance field and the linewidth are found to change steadily as the temperature is increased, without any discontinuity or singularity at the transition temperature TN = 185 K. The experimental results are compared with available data on other one-dimensional compounds.
0	Abstract   The surface composition and electronic structure of carburized tungsten trioxide, which is prepared by heating WO 3  in carbon monoxide atmosphere at 700°C, are investigated using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The relationship between the surface composition and the catalytic activity for methanol electro-oxidation is clarified. The formation of tungsten carbide at the surface enhances the catalytic activity. On the other hand, the presence of free carbon or tungsten trioxide in the surface layer reduces the activity remarkably. It is also shown that, the higher the electronic density of states near the Fermi level, the higher the catalytic activity. Additionally, the catalytic behavior of tungsten carbide for methanol electro-oxidation is mentioned.
0	New porous heterostructured nanohybrid of MgO-TiO2-Al2O3/montmorillonite has been successfully synthesized by an inflating, intercalation, and reassembling method under the ultrasonic vibration. The synthesized material was characterized by TGA-DTG, XRD, TEM and elemental analysis. The results showed that the material had a specific surface area of 156 m(2) g(-1) with an average pore diameter of 2.68 nm and pore volume of 0.6627 cm(3) g(-1), and that the MgO, TiO2 and Al2O3 nanoparticles were introduced in the montmorillonite by the heat treatment of 500 degrees C. It was found that the intercalation and deposition of mixed oxides nanoparticles expanded the basal spacing of montmorillonite, and the crystallites of the nanohybrids were assembled to form a heterostructured composite.

0	Abstract   Temperature dependent neutron powder diffraction has been used to study brownmillerite-type Sr2Co2O5(B) from room temperature to 920°C. The following phenomena were observed: (I) a magnetic transition at 278°C; (II) a reconstructive transition to a rhombohedral phase (R) between 530°C and 588°C; (III) at 747°C, the (R) phase is transformed into another phase (R′), close to the rhombohedral; (IV) above 882°C a cubic perovskite-type phase (P) is obtained, which is transformed again, by cooling, into the phase (R′) at 840°C. This study shows that anionic vacancies in the perovskite structure at high temperature are not long range ordered. The ordering of vacancies to give the (B) phase is established in a few seconds during the quenching process.
1	Abstract   Poly-4-bromostyrene (PBS) is shown to have desirable combination of properties, including high sensitivity and high resolution. As a consequence, it is a very attractive candidate for high performance electron beam lithography. The dependence of resist contrast and sensitivity on molecular weight is reported.
0	Abstract   Submicron powder of CrO2 was prepared by hydrothermal synthesis method from chromium trioxide with use of special modifiers, which govern the growth of particles. Particles obtained were of rounded form with mean diameter about 120 nm. The powder (stabilized with thin surface layer of     β    -CrOOH) has been characterized by structural, X-ray and magnetic measurements. The powder under investigation (with Curie temperature about 385 K) was cold-pressed and its transport and magnetotransport properties have been measured in the temperature range 4–450 K in magnetic field up to 1.6 T. The samples studied is characterized by non-metallic temperature behavior of resistance and large negative magnetoresistance (MR) in low temperature range. At    T  =  5    K the MR magnitude has been    −  17   % at    H  =  0.3    T and    −  20   % at    H  =  1.4    T. Its magnitude decreased fast with increase in temperature reducing to 0.3% and less for    T  &gt;  200    K. It is shown that this MR behavior is inherent for a system of magnetic grains with spin-dependent intergrain tunnelling. Some peculiarities of MR behavior in low-temperature range (below 40 K) can be associated with percolating character of tunnelling conductivity of this granular system under conditions of availability of only few conducting current paths through the sample.
0	Abstract   Carbon nanotubes (CNT) are being intensely investigated and explored as an alternative to the use of traditional metals in the interconnects for 3D chip-stacking, because of its numerous advantageous properties, in particular high thermal and electrical conductivity that are several times higher than of any comparable metal. In this work, we have successfully implemented growth and realized functional integration of multiwalled-CNT bundles in sub-5 μm diameter, high-aspect ratio ‘Through-Silicon-Vias’ (TSV). Large-area growth of CNT bundles was realized in TSVs on top of metal-lines in a bottom-up approach, at complimentary-metal-oxide-semiconductor processing-compatible temperatures. An innovative approach for minimization of the interfacial-barrier contact resistance between CNT and metal-lines was adopted, by introducing an alloy of Al-rich Al 2 O 3  as catalyst-holding layer, instead of conventional 10 nm. Good electrical-contact between metal-lines to CNTs is observed. A repeatable, non-destructive approach was used for electrical characterization studies of CNT-TSVs. The combined electrical resistance of an individual CNT-filled TSV was found to be ∼1.2 kΩ. Issues related to selective deposition of Fe-catalyst thin-film at the TSV-bottom, and growth of the CNTs from TSV sidewalls were solved by novel approach of wafer-to-wafer bonding. Structural investigations proved that as-grown CNT bundles are anchored robustly in the metal-layers.
0	Abstract   Cu(Cr1−xMnx)O2 delafossite thin films (0 ⩽ x ⩽ 15 at.%), with a c-axis quasi-epitaxial orientation, were prepared by pulsed laser deposition. The effects of Mn content on microstructure and physical properties were investigated. Both the variation of lattice constant c and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveal that the Mn ions substitute for Cr3+ as Mn3+ and Mn4+. The proportion of Mn4+ is gradually increased with the Mn doping, leading to the changes of hole density and mobility. As a result, the p-type conductivity is decreased at first and then increased. The conduction mechanism is thermal activation between 130 and 300 K. It is indicated that the PLD method and the Mn3+–O–Mn4+ and Mn3+–O–Cr3+ double-exchange interactions are favorable to the high hole density and mobility, respectively. Meanwhile, the double-exchange interactions produce the near-room-temperature ferromagnetism. The saturation magnetization and Curie temperature are gradually increased with the Mn content. For optical properties, all thin films have a comparatively high transmittance for visible light, with the highest value 70% for x = 15 at.% at the wavelength of 750 nm. As increasing the Mn content, the transparency and direct optical bandgap exhibit the similar trend as the hole density. With the relatively balanced electrical, magnetic and optical properties, these pulsed-laser-deposition-grown Cu(Cr1−xMnx)O2 thin films are expected to become a promising p-type transparent diluted magnetic semiconductor material.
0	Abstract   Studies of an alkali-aggregate reaction in Nova Scotia have shown that it differs in important characteristics from the well-known alkali-silica reaction. It is discussed in relation to previously published concepts of mechanism and an explanation is proposed for the alkali-expansivity of some Appalachian rocks.
0	Abstract   It is well known that mechanical characteristics of the fibre-matrix interface in MMCs have a strong influence on various properties. However, there is much uncertainty surrounding the question of how best to control the structure of the interfacial region in order to optimise particular types of composite performance. In this paper current thinking on how interfacial characteristics affect composite properties is briefly summarised. The importance of different types of stress relaxation procesess is emphasised. This is followed by some observationsabout testing procedures designed to measure bond strength in MMCs. It is noted that these invariably involve predominantly shear loading, whereas there is a need to explore the response of interfaces to tensile and mixed mode conditions. Finally, some observations are presented on interfacial chemical reactions and the development of fibre coatings.
0	Abstract   Five new compounds in the  A   x   M TeO 6  family were prepared and structurally characterized: Li 2 GeTeO 6 , Na 2 TiTeO 6 , Na 2 SnTeO 6 , and two forms of Na 2 GeTeO 6 . All compounds are layered structures based on various stacking arrangements of  M TeO 2−  6  layers. The structures of BaGeTeO 6  and SrGeTeO 6  were also determined. The former compound was found to contain Ba 2+  in trigonal prismatic coordination, in agreement with previous literature reports, while SrGeTeO 6  contains Sr 2+  in octahedral coordination and is not isostructural with BaGeTeO 6  as was previously reported. Structural characterizations were carried out using a variety of tools, including Rietveld refinements of X-ray and neutron powder diffraction data, solid-state MAS–NMR, and Raman and infrared spectroscopy. With the exception of  M =Ti 4+ , the MTeO 2−  6  layers show a high degree of order between  M  4+  and Te 6+  cations within the layers, but the stacking faults are generally present, which results in a significant decrease in the long-range ordering of the  M  4+  and Te 6+  cations in the third dimension. The compound K 2− x  Na  x  TiTeO 6  was prepared by reacting Na 2 TiTeO 6  and KNO 3  under hydrothermal conditions at 200°C in a Teflon-lined Parr bomb. This compound adopts a pyrochlore structure with cell edge 10.18 A. NMR measurements indicate a disordered Ti/Te distribution.
0	Abstract   Spark plasma sintering (SPS) was employed to join monolithic β-SiC with or without titanium as intermediate joining material. Both the localized and rapid heating contributed to the inherent energy saving of electric current assisted joining technique. The effects of uniaxial pressure and surface preparation were analyzed independently with respect to the flexural strength and the morphology of the joints. In particular samples polished down to 1 μm and joined at 1900 °C for 5 min achieved the strength of the as received material. The failure occurred outside the joining interface, confirming the optimum quality of the joint. Pressure in combination with surface preparation was necessary to achieve perfect adhesion and pore free direct joining of SiC. The use of Ti foil as a joining material and pressure allowed joining of unpolished SiC.
0	Abstract   A layer of magnetite Fe3O4 nanoparticles is first loaded onto the surfaces of cenospheres using ferric trichloride, ferrous chloride, and aqueous ammonia by a precipitation method, and then modified with silane coupling agent KH550. The modified Fe3O4 coated cenospheres are coated further with a film of anatase TiO2 nanoparticles under hydrothermal conditions, and finally decorated with Ag nanoparticles by electroless deposition. The surface morphology, chemical composition, crystalline structure, magnetic properties, and optical behaviors of cenosphere before and after treatments are determined by means of field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), X-ray diffractometry (XRD), vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM), and diffuse reflectance spectrum (DRS). The synthetic route for the formation of Ag decorated Fe3O4/TiO2 core/shell coating on cenosphere surfaces is established. The photocatalytic activity of the as-prepared cenospheres for the methylene blue degradation is measured under both ultraviolet and visible light irradiation. The results show that the Ag decorated Fe3O4/TiO2 coated cenospheres having a saturation magnetization of 21 emu g−1 are fabricated. After decoration with Ag the photocatalytic activity of the Fe3O4/TiO2 coated cenospheres is greatly improved under visible light irradiation because of the strong scattering and absorption properties of Ag nanoparticles. The silicon–oxygen interlayer between Fe3O4 core and TiO2 shell can be employed to prevent photodissolution of Fe3O4 during photocatalysis.
0	Abstract   Ba 0.5 Sr 0.5 TiO 3 –MgO (BST–MgO) composite has been prepared in situ by a citrate gel process, which is characterized by differential thermal analysis, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, infrared and dielectric spectroscopy. Results show that BST–MgO composite powders can be derived by pH=7 precursor calcined at 700 °C. The BST–MgO composite sintered at 1300 °C exhibits good dielectric properties, with permittivity of 730, loss tangent of 0.002 and tunability of 20.8%.
1	Abstract   The traditional melt flow rate (MFR) equipment has been broadly renovated in recent years. In particular, important modifications have been applied to the reading system which have allowed full automation of the instrument. On the whole, these improvements may greatly enhance the quality control, which is still the aim of the basic instrument.  As a consequence of the applied improvements, however, interesting new experimental fields have been opened, turning routine analysis equipment into interesting analytical tools. The paper aims to briefly show the new experimental possibilities; such as the evaluation of melt density, the filler content of a filled polymer, and the thermal stability.
0	Abstract   The Co70Mo30 alloy structure formed at different temperatures was studied by means of transmission electron microscopy and photoelectron spectroscopy. It has been found that at temperatures below the solidus temperature the alloy has a tendency toward phase separation which leads to formation of a quasi-cellular microstructure in the form of clusters strongly enriched in Mo and Co, respectively, but existing within a common fcc lattice of the solvent. At low temperatures, an allotropic phase transition α-Co → e-Co occurs in the alloy and the strain contrast, arising at such transitions is superimposed on the quasi-cellular structure. The Co70Mo30 alloy acquires high hardness due to the fact that the crystal lattice in the clusters strongly enriched in Mo remains face-centered.
0	Abstract   The diffusion length of minority carriers in a CdS-CdTe thin film polycrystalline junction device was measured using Electron Beam Induced Current. The EBIC response did not resemble the approximately exponential shape predicted by current theory. Rather it consisted of a broad region located approximately at the junction but consisting of multiple peaks and notched tails. Accordingly, a general model of the EBIC response was developed which takes into account surface recombination, finite generation volume, and grain boundary recombination to account for the features seen in the data. The important role of grain boundary recombination velocity can be seen in the model.
0	Abstract   The stability of charged defects in PuO 2  are systematically investigated by quasi-annealing simulations based on local spin density approximation (LSDA) +  U  calculations. The formation energies of intrinsic (Frenkel and Schottky pairs) and extrinsic (single vacancy or interstitial) defects at different charged states are calculated and presented. According to our results, the noninteracting oxygen Frenkel pairs made of the association of doubly charged defects are the most favorable form of intrinsic defects, the formation energy of which is in good agreement with experimental values. The negative charged oxygen interstitial (     I  O   2  −      ) and positive charged oxygen vacancy (     V  O   2  +      ) defects have the lowest formation energies at oxygen-rich and oxygen-poor environments, respectively, and thus are the most commonly seen extrinsic defects. Both the existences of oxygen vacancy and oxygen interstitial induce new electronic states in the band gap of stoichiometric PuO 2 , showing doping effects.
1	Abstract   Electron spin resonance (ESR) investigations of polyethylene, irradiated with accelerated sulphur ions, are reported. The temperature dependence of resonance line parameters in the range 20–260°C, has been studied. Additional ESR data on polyethylene irradiated with neutrons as well as on polyethylene thermally degraded in air are presented. The nature of the free radicals induced by irradiation is discussed.
0	A family of molecular centers of the type (RO2M)2+ is shown to exist in the alkaline earth fluorides MF2 (M = Ca, Sr, Ba) doped with R = Sc, Y, Lu, Ho when these crystals have been hydrolyzed and subsequently X-rayed. The centers were identified with the aid of Raman spectroscopy and, in the past, with electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR).
0	Abstract   The effect of hot extrusion on the strength and ductility of particulate silicon-carbide-reinforced aluminium alloy (Al–5% Si–0.2% Mg) composites has been studied. Cast ingots of the matrix alloy and the composites were extruded at 500 °C at an extrusion ratio of 10:1. The microstructures and mechanical properties of the composite samples and the matrix alloy have been investigated in the as-cast state and after extrusion, and are compared with the mechanical properties of hot-forged composites of the same composition. The extruded microstructures have a more uniform distribution of the SiC particles and the eutectic silicon by comparison with as-cast microstructures. Evaluation of the mechanical properties show that the extruded samples have strength and ductility values superior to those of the as-cast counterparts. In the extruded samples the addition of increasing amounts of particulate SiC increases the yield and tensile strength and decreases the ductility. The ductility level of the extruded samples is found to be higher than those of the forged and as cast samples.
0	Abstract   Single crystals of a new manganese antimony oxide. β-MnSb 2 O 6 , are obtained by heatling a mixtore of Sb 2 O 3  and Mn 2 O 3  in a molar ratio of 5:2 up to 1000°C. Crystal structure is determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction methods. The cell parameters are    a   = 8.8056(1)   A     ,    c   = 4.7232(1)   A      and the space group P3 with 3 formulae par unit cell. Thermal stability is studied by means of thermogravlmetrlc analysis.
0	Abstract   Conductivity, σ, of MnF2 and MgF2 single crystals, pure and doped (with Li+, Na+, Y3+, Gd3+), has been measured, from room temperature to 500°C. Further, some crystals were contaminated with O2− as an additional impurity. These tetragonal (rutile structure) crystals both behave like typical ionic conductors. Of particular interest is the existence of a large anisotropy, σ being largest when measured parallel to the c-axis. Study of the conductivity isotherms and anisotropy as functions of impurity concentration allows identification of the conduction mechanism in terms of the migration of two mobile defects: the fiuorine-ion vacancy, VF, and interstitial, Fi. A value of 1.44 eV was obtained for the enthalpy of formation of the intrinsic anion Frenkel defect, 0.80 eV for the migration enthalpy of a VF and 0.88 eV for an F1 in MnF2 parallel to the c-axis. Similar values were obtained for MgF2. This work shows that more information about point defects can be obtained from conductivity measurements in non-cubic cyrstals than in cubic ionic crystals, because of the additional information from conductivity anisotropy.
0	Abstract   The optical properties in the IR region (plasma resonance frequency ωp, relaxation time τ, high-frequency permittivity ϵ∞) and the transport coefficients (electrical conductivity σ⊥, Hall constant RH(   B   ∥   c   ), Seebeck coefficient α) of Bi2Se3 single crystals with various contents of incorporated In atoms have been determined.  The dependence of the values of ωp, σ⊥, RH(   B   ∥   c   ), α of Bi2−xInxSe3 crystals on the In-atom concentration x exhibit an extremum near x = 0.1 showing that the free electron concentration increases up to x = 0.1, then decreases. This effect is explained using the idea that anti-site defects exist in the Bi2Se3 crystal lattice.  The interaction of In atoms with the anti-site defects leads to the formation of uncharged but positively polarized point defects InBi(+δ) and to the decrease of the anti-site defect concentration. The decrease of the anti-site defect concentration is interpreted in the following way: the increasing bond polarity of bonds InBi-Se1 and InBi-Se2 results in the decrease of the probability of anti-site defect formation. Using the experimentally determined dependence of the free-carrier concentration on the x value the energy of anti-site defect formation, E0(BiSe') = 0.37 eV, has been calculated. The ideas concerning the changes in the bond polarity arising from the increasing content of In atoms have been supported by the quantum chemical calculation of the bonding parameters in Bi2−xInxSe3 crystals. The physical properties of Bi2Se3 and Bi2Te3 crystals were compared. PACS classification numbers: 61.70.Ey;61.50.Lt.
1	Abstract   Measurements have been made of the transient current response of InP samples following the application of a voltage step during the transit of a dipole domain through the sample. From these measurements values of the domain charge and differential capacitance have been derived as functions of the domain potential. The relationship between domain charge and voltage in InP is found to be different from that suggested by simple domain theory and found experimentally in GaAs of comparable carrier density. An approximate form for the electron velocity-electric field characteristic of InP is derived from the experimental data and evidence is presented to suggest that this represents an upper limit to the true characteristic.
1	Abstract   A small-signal a.c. admittance ( y -parameter) circuit model is developed by physical analysis of the basic MOSFET structure by using a small signal analysis. The frequency dependent solutions for the derived set of equations for the  y -parameters yield results that match experimental data extremely well. The real parts of the  y -parameters vary as  ω  2 , while the imaginary parts vary linearly. In carrying out the analysis it was necessary to add parasitic elements to the physical MOSFET model as well as include the effects of channel length modulation. The  y -parameters are expressed as a function of the MOSFET parameters, parasitic elements, frequency and bias conditions.
0	Abstract   Ge nanocrystals embedded in Silicon oxide matrix have been synthesized on Si substrate by co-sputtering of SiO 2  and Ge using RF magnetron sputtering technique. The as deposited films were subjected to microwave annealing at 800 and 900 °C. The structural characterization was performed by using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectrometry. XRD measurements confirmed the formation of Ge nanocrystals. Raman scattering spectra showed a peak of Ge–Ge vibrational mode around 299 cm −1 , which was caused by quantum confinement of phonons in the Ge nanocrystals. Variation of the nanocrystal size with annealing temperature has been discussed. Advantages of microwave annealing are explained in detail.
0	Solid solutions of formula NaNb /SUB 1-x/ W /SUB x/ O/sub 3/ (0 less than or equal to x less than or equal to 1) have have been prepared using a high pressure technique and their structural evolution observed as Nb/sup 5 +/ is substituted by W/sup 5 +/. Five phases with perovskite-related structures have been identified: two orthorhombic phases with space group Pbma (0 less than or equal to x less than or equal to 0.16 and 0.20 less than or equal to x less than or equal to 0.40), another orthorhombic phase whose b axis is approximately one quarter of the former (0.40 &lt; x &lt; 0.52) and two cubic phases (x approx. = 0.16 and 0.52 less than or equal to x less than or equal to 1). An attempt is made to correlate the complex evolution with x of the lattice parameters in the orthorhombic phases with the change of octahedron size and tilting angles.
1	Abstract   The effects of incubation pH on the morphology, the surface charge and the deformability of a single living human red blood cell (RBC) were studied. A novel multi-dimensional microscope was employed to perform real time, non-invasive  in situ  measurements on the cell shape and size, as well as the membrane bending and shearing elastic moduli of the cell. A phase-analysis micro-electrophoresis laser scattering technique was used to measure the surface charge density. It was shown that the incubation pH markedly influences the surface charge density and the membrane elastic properties of the RBCs and thus leads to a change in their morphology and deformability.
0	Abstract   CoZrTa films deposited on polymer sheet substrates at room temperature have been investigated for application to the backlayer in double-layered media for perpendicular magnetic recording systems. The relationships between the Ta content  x , the magnetostriction constant λ and magnetic characteristics such as coercivity  H  c  and relative permeability  μ  r  have been clarified. A new measurement method for evaluating the λ of soft magnetic thin films deposited on polymer sheet substrates is presented. Films with the compositions (Co 96.7 Zr 4.3 ) 100− x  Ta  x  , with  x  = 10 at%, possessed sufficiently soft magnetism such as lower  H  c   μ  r  &gt; 600. The addition of Ta was found to be effective in changing the sign of λ from positive to negative. It was found that the negative magneto-elastic energy and the smaller λ cause the very soft magnetism.
0	Abstract   Conductivity measurements are presented for the NdBa 2 Cu 3 O 6+ δ   superconductor. The measurements were carried out both in the high temperature range (350 T  −4  P (O 2 ) −1  atm, and in the low temperature range (10 T  δ  δ  δ  δ &gt;0.64–0.69; (c) in the tetragonal phase an Anderson localisation of the charge carriers driven by band fluctuation at the Fermi level is likely responsible for the semiconducting trend of resistivity vs.  T  below 300 K; (d) the  T  c  vs.  δ  curve does not present the typical 60 K plateau, and (e) the room temperature ageing has no effect on  T  c .
0	Abstract   Several key experimental results are not successfully explained by current models for the thermal oxidation of Si in dry O 2 . The three issues we consider here are (1) the sublinear pressure dependence of the oxidation rate for thin oxides, (2) the formation of oxide on the outer SiO 2  surface during the “initial fast process”, and (3) the effect of gas phase/SiO 2  surface mechanisms on oxidation kinetics. We develop a parallel oxidation model with specific physical mechanisms related to the above phenomena. This model is fit to oxidation thickness versus time data for an extensive data set for thicknesses between 6 nm and 1 ωm.
1	An innovative non-destructive evaluation (NDE) technique is presented based on current stimulated thermography. Modulated electric current is injected to Carbon Fibre Reinforced Plastics (CFRP) laminates as an external source of thermal excitation. Pulsed Phase Thermography (PPT) is concurrently employed to identify low velocity impact induced (LVI) damage. The efficiency of the proposed method is demonstrated for both plain and with Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) modified laminates, which are subjected to low-velocity impact damaged composite laminates at different energy levels. The presence of the nano reinforcing phase is important in achieving a uniform current flow along the laminate, as it improves the through thickness conductivity. The acquired thermographs are compared with optical PPT, C-scan images and Computer Tomography (CT) representations. The typical energy input for successful damage identification with current injection is three to four orders of magnitude less compared to the energy required for optical PPT.
1	Abstract   The interaction between an atom and a phonon is evaluated at a surface. The basic assumption is that the total potential energy of the atom  V (  r  ) can be written as the sum of pair interactions  w (  r  -  r   1 ) with individual substrate atoms. The result is an expansion in phonon wavevector  q , with coefficients expressed in terms of the equilibrium adsorption potential. The coupling can be utilized in calculations of kinetic and equilibrium properties of adsorbed atoms.
1	Abstract   In this paper, the effect of residual stresses and weld geometry on the fatigue life of butt welded joints was studied by developing an analytical model using Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM), superposition and finite element approaches. Various configurations of residual stresses and weld geometry in butt welded joints were considered and corresponding effective stress intensity factors were calculated by using Bueckner's and Kanazawa's weight functions for an edge and a central through-thickness crack in finite plate respectively and Newman-Raju's empirical equation was used for semi-elliptical surface crack. Fatigue life of butt welds subjected to various weld geometries and residual stress configurations in as-welded condition and post-weld treated condition were calculated by using Paris' law with the effective range of stress intensity factor for zero-to-tensile loading (R=0) and compared with the available experimental data.
0	Abstract   Novel p-type NiO/n-type CeO2 heterojunctions, with cubic NiO particles embedded on the CeO2 nanofibers, were successfully prepared by the electrospinning technique. The photocatalytic activity for MB degradation under UV light irradiation of the NiO/CeO2 heterojunction is much higher than that of pure NiO or CeO2. The rate constant of MB degradation by NiO/CeO2 is about 4 times and 2 times than those of pure NiO and CeO2 under UV light irradiation, respectively. The excellent photocatalytic activity of the NiO/CeO2 heterostructures is closely related to the fast transfer and efficient separation of electron–hole pairs between NiO and CeO2 due to the formation of the heterojunction and their matching band positions.
0	Abstract   The fine structure of the M45N45N45 Palladium Auger transition was investigated. The energy of the peaks and the changes of their shapes due to surface modifications, either by alloying or by oxidation are studied. It is found that the fine structure is due to the overlapping of two “band-like” transitions of the type M4VV and M5VV.
1	Abstract   The degradation and glass transition temperatures of a series of methyl methacrylate (MMA)-ethyl α-hydroxymethylacrylate (EHMA) copolymers have been studied by t.g.a./i.r. and d.s.c. Thermal degradation yielded intramolecular lactone and intermolecular crosslinking formation, with concurrent loss of ethanol and/or methanol involving adjacent or near-neighbour EHMA or MMA units. Glass transitions of copolymers have been analysed as a function of sequence distribution and their values compared to the theoretical ones derived using Johnston's equation. The partially degraded copolymers increased their glass transition temperatures as a consequence of the above mentioned lactone and crosslinking formation.
0	Based on the pseudopotential approach, the lattice vibration and polaron properties in InP under pressure up to 8 GPa have been investigated. At zero pressure, our calculated values for all features of interest are in reasonable agreement with data available in literature. Upon compression, the optical phonon modes at Γ point in the Brillouin zone are shifted towards high energies and their frequencies display a blueshift with rising pressure. The splitting of the longitudinal and transverse optical phonons narrows under pressure, indicating thus a decrease of the ionicity of InP crystal with pressure. It is observed that all physical quantities being studied in this contribution behave monotonically upon compression. To the best of the author's knowledge, the pressure dependence of the polaron properties for InP in the present study is reported for the first time.
0	Abstract   Metastable states arise in mixed states of superconductors due to their layered structure or due to trapping of vortices by defects (or due to both). We give a general expression for the life time of a metastable state and investigate it in detail near cross-over temperature between classical and quantum regimes.
0	Abstract   Photoluminescence (PL) and cathodoluminescence (CL) of light emitting diode samples with various InGaN/GaN multi-quantum-well (MQW) active structures and a range of dislocation density (∼7×108/cm2 to ∼9×109/cm2) were investigated. Results indicate that threading dislocations have impact on the luminescence of GaN thin films and act as a nonradiative recombination center. It was also observed that the optical emission is affected by MQW structure such as the number of quantum wells.
1	Abstract   The present study investigates the sequential pressure filtration of two filter cake layers with a maximum grain size of 3 mm and 1 mm, respectively, using a water soluble additive system consisting of xanthan and guar gum. The pressure slip casting of the resulting composites was optimized with a factorial experimental design. The best combination was a lower filtration pressure for the first filter cake layer and a higher filtration pressure for the second one. Furthermore, a shorter filtration time of the first filter cake layer together with the application of a filter aid of a xanthan/guar gum solution resulted in an easy demolding of crack-free graded composites with an excellent bonding. The results of the full factorial experimental design were verified by X-ray computed tomography. The demonstrated pressure slip casting of graded refractories offers the possibility to produce functional composites with tailored compositions, microstructure and thus functionality.
0	Abstract   The effect of bath temperature on Cu 2 SnSe 4  films prepared by electrodeposition was studied in this work. The structure, morphology and composition of the films were analysed by using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive analysis of X-rays (EDAX). The band gap energy and type of optical transition were determined from optical absorbance data. The results showed that electrodeposition of Cu 2 SnSe 4  films was most suitable to be obtained at room temperature. Increasing the bath temperature did not improve the crystallinity of Cu 2 SnSe 4  compound, but to formation of binary phase, CuSe. EDAX studies showed that increasing the temperature resulted in drastic increase in Cu content and decrease in Sn content. The optical absorption studies showed the film deposited at room temperature has direct transition with band gap energy  E  g  of 1.2 eV.
0	Abstract   Electron momentum densities (EMD) in Al, V, Cr and Cu metals have been estimated from the metallic electron charge densities by applying the procedure of Burkhardt, Konya and Coulson and March. The procedure has provided spherically averaged EMD from which corresponding Compton profiles, J(q) and 〈pn〉 expectation values have been computed. These theoretical results show satisfactory agreement with the experimental data for Al, V, Cr and Cu.
0	Abstract   Hexagonal NaYF 4  microcrystals with controllable morphologies and tunable sizes have been successfully synthesized by a facile hydrothermal method. The influences of the molar ratios of trisodium citrate (Cit 3− ) to Y 3+  and pH values on the phase and morphology evolution were investigated and discussed in detail. It is found that trisodium citrate and pH value as two significant external factors play key roles in the formation of the anisotropic architectures of β-NaYF 4  microcrystals. Taking hexagonal β-NaYF 4  microprisms as a candidate, the possible formation mechanism has been proposed on the basis of time-dependent experiments. In addition, the upconversion (UC) luminescence properties of β-NaYF 4 :Yb 3+ /Er 3+  samples were systematically studied and discussed. The results reveal that the UC luminescence properties are strongly dependent on their morphologies and sizes. This study not only provides important information for shape-controlled synthesis of other complex rare earth fluoride compounds, but also gives a reference for exploration of morphology- and size-dependent UC luminescence properties.
0	We investigated the corrosion defects of TbFeCo films in magneto-optical disks. There were two types of corrosion defects (A-type and B-type) which arose from the oxides. The A-type defect grew rapidly and became a large corrosion site. The main centre of the A-type defect was a pin-hole with large dust grains in the film. This should be prevented because it seriously degrades media life. The B-type defect was small and it was presumed to break out at the boundary between the substrate and the film. By eliminating the large dust grains, the centres of the A-type growth, we can obtain from the fabrication process highly reliable disks whose median life is estimated to be 336 y.
0	Abstract   Attempts to measure the magnetoresistance of a metal multilayer with the current in the growth direction can usefully employ a strategy which maximises the resistance to be measured. We describe preliminary attempts to achieve this by making arrays of multilayer mesas joined by Nb interconnects. At 4.2 K the Nb is superconducting, leaving only the resistance of the multilayer. For a given multilayer resistivity, our approach increases the measured resistance by raising the sample length whilst reducing its cross-sectional area.
1	Biocompatibility of dentin bonding agents (DBA) and composite resin may affect the treatment outcome (e.g., healthy pulp, pulpal inflammation, pulp necrosis) after operative restoration. Bisphenol-glycidyl methacrylate (BisGMA) is one of the major monomers present in DBA and resin. Prior studies focused on salivary esterase for metabolism and degradation of resin monomers clinically. This study found that human dental pulp cells expressed mainly carboxylesterase-2 (CES2) and smaller amounts of CES1A1 and CES3 isoforms. Exposure to BisGMA stimulated CES isoforms expression of pulp cells, and this event was inhibited by catalase. Exogenous addition of porcine esterase prevented BisGMA- and DBA-induced cytotoxicity. Interestingly, inhibition of CES by bis(p-nitrophenyl) phosphate (BNPP) and CES2 by loperamide enhanced the cytotoxicity of BisGMA and DBA. Addition of porcine esterase or N-acetyl-l-cysteine prevented BisGMA-induced prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and PGF2α production. In contrast, addition of BNPP and loperamide, but not mevastatin, enhanced BisGMA-induced PGE2 and PGF2α production in dental pulp cells. These results suggest that BisGMA may induce the cytotoxicity and prostanoid production of pulp cells, leading to pulpal inflammation or necrosis via reactive oxygen species production. Expression of CES, especially CES2, in dental pulp cells can be an adaptive response to protect dental pulp against BisGMA-induced cytotoxicity and prostanoid release. Resin monomers are the main toxic components in DBA, and the ester group is crucial for monomer toxicity.
0	Abstract   Magnetovolume effects in γ-Co 1− x  Mn  x   and γ-Co 1− x  (FeMn)  x   alloys have been investigated in the concentration range where ferromagnetism, spin-glass and antiferromagnetism are present. The spontaneous volume magnetostriction is found to be positive and to increase with increasing  x  as the Neel temperature increases. The forced volume magnetostriction vanishes in the antiferromagnetic samples.
0	Abstract   Gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) have been successfully biosynthesized by Chenopodium murale (C. murale) leaf extract. Au NPs were incorporated within polyethylene oxide (PEO)/polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) blend by casting method. Prepared samples were characterized before and after subjecting to successive gamma-irradiation doses (1, 2, 3, 4, 5 Mrad). XRD confirmed the semicrystalline nature of blend which was largely decreased after embedding Au NPs and subsequently through high irradiation doses. Before irradiation, FT-IR spectra revealed presence of main vibrational bands due to both PEO and PVP. After irradiation, FT-IR spectra indicated the existence of structural rearrangements in the polymeric matrix due to irradiation process. UV/vis spectra indicated presence of n–π* transition results from single-bond in the backbone of blend and showed a visible band at 531 nm attributed to the surface plasmon resonance of Au NPs that is largely affected by irradiation dose. The values of optical parameters were enhanced due to embedding Au NPs and varied according to the irradiation dose. TEM images showed that particle size range was reduced from 1 to 34 nm for nanocomposite to 4–22 nm after exposure to γ-radiations of 5 Mrad. TGA analysis showed an improvement for the thermal stability of nanocomposite sample after gamma-rays treatment.
1	Abstract   Recent rapid progress in IC-manufacturing requires more accurate knowledge of the spatial distribution of implanted ions in crystalline targets, particularly on channeling and dechanneling processes of the implanted ions which causes disordering of target atoms. For this we have developed a new computer simulation code to simulate how the crystalline structure undergoes disordering due to ion implantation and how this disordering affects successive ion implantation, leading to considerably modified spatial distribution.  The simulation program is based on the MARLOWE code which is widely used in calculating atomic binary collision problems either for crystalline targets or for amorphous targets. Besides all functions of the MARLOWE code, the present simulation code is capable of handling cases where the damage due to ion implantation plays an important role. The functional representation of the Ziegler—Biersack—Littmark (ZBL) potential is used in the present code instead of the original Moliere potential. The new simulation code also has an option to choose the approximate formula for calculating atom trajectories in order to reduce computation time.

A simple method to measure rough values of the diffusion coefficient and its dependence on submonolayer coverage is described and tested. In the region around (001) the displacement energy found is about 1.30 eV/atom up to 10 15  atoms/cm 2  where it decreases to 0.78 eV/atom. In the residual region except (110) this energy at 1.5 × 10 14  atoms/cm 2  is 1.22 eV/atom, it decreases at 4 × 10 14  atoms/cm 2  to 0.61 eV/atom and increases at 10 15  atoms/cm 2  to 0.78 eV/atom. Corresponding values of the diffusion coefficient  D  and of the preexponential  D  0  are given. The dependence of  D  on submonolayer coverage is discussed.
0	Abstract   Two new functional double oxides, Bi 2 MTaO 7  (M = Ga and In), were synthesized by the conventional solid-state reaction method. They were characterized by the Rietveld structural analysis and UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. Bi 2 MTaO 7  have distorted pyrochlore-type structure. The lattice distortion of Bi 2 InTaO 7  (0.067) is larger than that of Bi 2 GaTaO 7  (0.039). The angle between the corner-linked MO 6  octahedral in Bi 2 InTaO 7  (143.4°) is closer to 180° than that of Bi 2 GaTaO 7  (128.3°). The abilities of the H 2  and O 2  evolution over Bi 2 MTaO 7  were evaluated from an aqueous CH 3 OH solution and an aqueous Ce(SO 4 ) 2  solution under UV light irradiation, respectively. The rates of the H 2  and O 2  evolution over Bi 2 InTaO 7  were clearly larger than that of Bi 2 GaTaO 7 . These results suggest that the abilities of the H 2  and O 2  evolution might be correlated with the lattice distortions and the angles between the corner-linked MO 6  octahedral in Bi 2 MTaO 7 .
0	Abstract   Measurement of the response of the flux-line lattice in NbSe 2  and La 1.825 Sr 0.075 CuO 4  show important differences between these two materials. In particular, we have studied the magnetic-field and angular dependence of the response of a high- Q  mechanical oscillator in fields of up to 1 T. The features seen in NbSe 2  seem to be well explained in terms of a change in the pinning regime, usually termed the “peak effect” in the critical current, using the collective-pinning model of Larkin and Ovchivnikov within Ginzburg-Landau anisotropic theory. On the other hand the behavior found in the high- T  c  material LSCO seems to fall naturally into a description which takes into account the possibility of phase transitions in the vortex lattice and the quasi-two-dimensional character of the superconductivity.
0	Abstract   Synchrotron X-radiation plane-wave topography for thinned silicon crystals is shown to be effective and sensitive for imaging minute strains around microdefects. Visibility of microdefects in crystals thinned down to a thickness (about 100 μm) smaller than several times the extinction distance is compared with that in crystals as thick (0.6 mm for Mo Kα 1 ) as μ -1  (μ: linear absorption coefficient). Various kinds of microdefects reveal themselves much more in the thinned crystals. Observed microdefects are classified into five morphological categories. One of the observed microdefects has an image extinction rule suggesting a specified strain field around it. The morphology of microdefects is described in detail.
0	Abstract   We have fabricated single grain boundary Josephson junctions (GBJs) by depositing c-axis oriented thin films of Bi 2 Sr 2 CaCu 2 O 8+ x   by laser ablation on SrTiO 3  bicrystal substrates. The films were patterned to form junctions in 11 different widths ranging from 1 to 100 μm. The electrical transport properties have been studied by recording the current voltage characteristics as a function of temperature and of the applied magnetic field.
1	Using an exact numerical diagonalization scheme, we calculated the low-lying spectra of a two-electron quantum dot with a confined parabolic potential in the presence of a Coulomb impurity at the center under a perpendicular homogeneous magnetic field. Numerical results show that for the low spectra of on-center acceptor impurity, the orbital angular momentum L-transition and/or spin angular momentum S-transition takes place in the ground state, which is qualitatively the same as the case without impurity, while for the low-lying spectra of on-center donor impurity, there are no ground state transitions and the energy spectra are completely different.
1	Abstract   The novel method to measure a local optical retardation has been proposed. By combining an electrically controllable birefringence (ECB) liquid crystal (LC) cell and image processing software, the local retardation of a polymer-stabilized blue phase (BP) with in-plane electric field has successfully been measured in a micrometer scale. When the optic axes of the sample and reference cells are aligned ±45° with respect to the crossed polarizers, the optical retardation of the sample is compensated by a reference ECB cell. In this geometry, the optical retardation or birefringence of micro-domains can be experimentally quantified by determining a complete compensation condition with electrically adjustable reference cell and image processing software. This method is very useful to measure Kerr constant of the BPLC more exactly and also can be applied for various samples that require a micrometer scale resolution for the measurement of optical retardation.
0	Abstract   The void swelling of irradiated materials is one of the critical problems in the first wall in future nuclear fusion reactors. There have been many reports on the growth of voids during irradiation, but a more important process is the nucleation of voids. To clarify the nucleation mechanism of voids, 304 stainless steel was irradiated and observed in-situ in a HVEM. The remarkable finding was the correspondence of the number density of the initial dislocation loop and the saturated void number density under various irradiation conditions. In this study the mechanism is discussed.
0	Abstract   Fracture toughness ( K  IC ), an important property of brittle materials, can be determined by indentation cracking tests. This paper reports on an investigation of the fracture toughness of a directionally solidified Al 3 Nb–Nb 2 Al–AlNbNi ternary eutectic, based on the Vickers indentation test applied to longitudinal and transverse sections of its microstructure. The measurements were taken using indentation loads varying from 2.45 to 24.5 N. Correlations between the resulting crack parameters and indentation load were evaluated using Palmqvist and half-penny cracks models. In the range of indentation loads studied, the results suggested that the Palmqvist model provided a better fit to the experimental data. Fracture toughness was calculated using equations developed for Palmqvist crack mode. The indentation fracture toughness values for longitudinal and transverse sections are in the range of 2.82–3.05 MPa m 1/2  and 2.98–3.59 MPa m 1/2 , respectively. It was found that the addition of Ni and incorporation of a third phase to the Al 3 Nb–Nb 2 Al eutectic improved fracture toughness of this  in situ  composite material.
0	Abstract   Cathode ray irradiation provides a new method of causing sensitized luminescence in the system CaF 2 :Ce:Mn. Energy transfer efficiencies (η =  I  Mn / I  total , where  I  Mn  and  I  total  are the emission intensity corresponding to the characteristic emission of the Mn 2+  ions and the total cathodoluminescence, respectively) observed in samples with varying concentrations of Ce and Mn and at different temperatures of excitation indicate a near constancy of these values up to 100°C. This result and the result that transfer efficiencies for cathode ray excitation are greater than those for optical excitation are also explained.
1	Abstract   In this paper, we have successfully identified the triangular-shaped defect structures with stacking fault tetrahedra. These structure often appeared in hard-sphere (HS) crystals grown on a square pattern under gravity. We have, so far, performed Monte Carlo simulations of the HS crystals under gravity. Single stacking faults as observed previously in the HS crystals grown on a flat wall were not seen in the case of square template. Instead, defect structures with triangular appearance in xz- and yz- projections were appreciable. We have identified them by looking layer by layer. Those structures are surrounded by stacking faults along face-centered cubic (fcc) {111}. Also, we see isolated vacancies and vacancy–interstitial pairs, and we have found octahedral structures surrounded by stacking faults along fcc {111}.
0	Abstract   The need for improved transverse performance of titanium matrix composites (TMCs) has stimulated efforts at developing fiber–matrix coatings with a better blend of transverse and longitudinal properties. In the first part of this paper, the critical requirements for an appropriate coating are examined, based on experience gained from single-fiber and single-ply tests on TMCs. Two new coatings are then discussed: (i) the Ti-Y-Ti system, abbreviated as TYT; and (ii), the sheathed SiC system. The coatings were characterized under transverse loading using the cruciform specimen geometry, and under longitudinal tension using a single-ply dog-bone geometry. The transverse strength of the TYT system was ≈160 MPa, and needs further improvement. The fiber had poor in situ strength, and is explained based on less than expected performance of the Y layer due to oxygen pickup and columnar grain structure. The sheathed fiber offered a better blend of transverse and longitudinal properties. Under transverse loading, the sheath remained load bearing until an applied stress as high as 550 MPa, compared with only 330 MPa for SCS-6 fibers. Under longitudinal tension, while the sheath cracked at relatively low stresses, the base SiC region appeared to retain a strength that was identical to a virgin carbon-coated Trimarc fiber. The sheathed fiber appears attractive for TMC laminates, and further experimental validation is suggested.
0	Abstract   Nanocrystalline CeO2–MOx mixed oxides (M = Mn, Fe) with different M/(M + Ce) molar ratio are prepared by sol–gel combustion method. X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), Temperature Programmed Reduction with H2 (H2-TPR) and N2-adsorption (BET) analyses are conducted to characterize the physical–chemical properties of the catalysts. The activity of catalysts for reduction of NOx with ammonia has been evaluated. The CeO2–MnOx catalysts showed better low temperature activity than CeO2–FeOx. The superior activity of CeO2–MnOx with Mn/(Mn + Ce) molar ratio of 0.25 respect to other catalysts (with 83% NO conversion and 68% N2 yield at 200 °C) is associated to nanocrystalline structure, reducibility at low temperature and synergistic effect between Ce and Mn that are observed by XRD, TEM and H2-TPR. The CeO2–FeOx catalysts were found to be active at high temperature, being Ce–Fe the best catalyst yielded 82% NO conversion at 300 °C. The effect of alkaline earth metals (Ca, Mg, Sr and Ba) loading on the structure and catalytic activity of cerium mixed oxides are also investigated. Loading of Ba enhanced the NO reduction activity of mixed oxides due to the increase of number of basic sites. Highest performance with 91% NO conversion and 80% N2 yield attained over CeO2–MnOx (0.25)-Ba (7%) catalyst at 200 °C.
0	Abstract   Diffusion of hydrogen atoms in β-VHx has been studied by means of a pulsed-NMR technique. A large temperature dependence of the activation energy towards the phase transition temperature βα has been noted, and is interpreted in terms of a saddle point energy and the energy of stabilization of c-octahedral sites relative to other sites.
0	Abstract   Cd 0.96 Zn 0.04 Te thin films are deposited onto well-cleaned glass substrates (Corning 7059) kept at room temperature by vacuum evaporation. Rutherford backscattering spectrometry and X-ray diffraction techniques are used to determine the thickness, composition and crystalline structure and grain size of the films, respectively. The films exhibited zinc blende structure with predominant (111) orientation. The surface morphology of the films is studied by scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy. The rms roughness of the as-deposited films is 3.7 nm. The Raman spectra of the films show longitudinal- and transverse-optical (LO, TO) modes, which arise from CdTe- and ZnTe-like vibrations. The photoluminescence spectrum of the films shows intense emission due to free and bound exciton recombination and no emission associated with crystal imperfection and deeper impurity levels. The pseudodielectric-function spectra,  e ( E )= e  1 ( E )+ ie  2 ( E ), of the films are measured by spectroscopic ellipsometry at room temperature. The measured dielectric function spectra reveal distinct structures at energies of the  E  1 ,  E  1 +Δ 1  and  E  2  critical points.
0	Abstract   We investigated the dehydrogenation of NaAlH 4  and the reversible low-pressure rehydrogenation from NaH to Na 3 AlH 6 . Highly purified NaAlH 4  requires relatively high temperatures to decompose to NaH and long durations to rehydride to the Na 3 AlH 6  phase in hydrogen gas. However, any degradation of the purity of this material, whether through ball milling with diamond powder or ball milling with diamond plus Al powders, mixing the purified material with Pt powder, or doping with a Ti organometallic compound, lowers the decomposition temperature and facilitates rehydriding the product NaH+Al to Na 3 AlH 6 . Diamond ball milling of NaAlH 4  seems to be the best of these procedures; it substantially decreases the decomposition temperatures, with significant dehydrogenation starting at 180 °C rather than 250 °C for the purified material, and with formation of NaH substantially complete at 235 °C rather than 290 °C. Rather surprisingly, it also facilitates rehydrogenation from NaH+Al to Na 3 AlH 6 . Similarly, NaAlH 4  doped with Ti according to the recipe of Bogdanovic lowers the decomposition temperatures and improves the hydrogenation kinetics for the low pressure transition from NaH+Al to Na 3 AlH 6 . Pressure–composition isotherms show that the rehydrogenation of the resulting NaH+Al decomposition phases into the Na 3 AlH 6  intermediate phase at pressures below 3.6 MPa is similar for the diamond ball milled and Ti-doped material. Diamond ball milling NaAlH 4  with excess Al did not improve the rehydrogenation kinetics.
1	The setting of gypsum plaster can be monitored by luminescence rigidochromism. The progress of the setting process which is accompanied by hardening is indicated by a blue shift of the phosphorescence of a suitable water soluble rhenium complex. This rigidity increase of the plaster/water mixture takes place in two phases. In the beginning the rigidity increase is rather large while in the second much longer phase it is relatively small. The addition of a plasticizer (or retarder) keeps the rigidity smaller in the beginning, but only slightly affects the final rigidity of the set plaster.
1	Abstract   The resonant property of the magnetic vortex confined in a square-shaped ferromagnetic dot has been investigated. We showed that the field dependence of the resonant frequency has a unique directional dependence originating from a four-fold rotational symmetry of the square. The resonant frequency is found to be strongly modulated by the magnetic field along the diagonal direction although the magnetic field applied along the side of the square hardly modified the resonant frequency. The modulation ratio of the resonant frequency defined by the ratio between minimum and maximum frequencies for the vortex resonance was found to be tuned by the lateral dimension of the square. These unique frequency tunabilities controlled by the magnitude and the direction of the magnetic field may provide additional functions in the application of the magnetic vortex systems.
1	Abstract   Even though a number of research studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of Fibre Reinforced Concrete (FRC) in improving the structural response of RC members under different loading conditions, some concerns recently arose on the sectional ductility under flexure which can be reduced under specific conditions. In fact, fibres do not significantly increase the ultimate moment of RC members and, with rather tough FRC and low strain-hardening ratio of the longitudinal rebars, the rotation capacity can substantially decrease owing to a cracking localization at ultimate limit state.  This paper focuses on this topic with a number of experimental results on full-scale FRC beams tested under flexure.  Experimental results evidence that fibres, when provided in sufficient amount, are able to move the beam failure from concrete crushing to steel rupture. Under certain circumstances, the overall ductility, measured in terms of displacements, may decrease.  On the other hand, in all cases the addition of fibres determines a stiffer and in general enhanced post-cracking behaviour in service conditions.
1	Abstract   This paper proposes an application of the 100 kWh superconducting flywheel energy storage systems to reduce the peak power of the electric railway system. The electric railway systems have high-power characteristics and large amount of regenerative energy during vehicles’ braking. The high-power characteristic makes operating cost high as the system should guarantee the secure capacity of electrical equipment and the low utilization rate of regenerative energy limits the significant energy efficiency improvement. In this paper, it had been proved that the peak power reduction and energy efficiency improvement can be achieved by using 100 kWh superconducting flywheel energy storage systems with the optimally controlled charging or discharging operations. Also, economic benefits had been assessed.
0	Abstract   The influence is studied of the partial substitution of Fe 3+  with Sc 3+  in ferrites with general formula Mg 1.2 Mn 0.4 Sc  x  Fe 1.6− x  O 4 . It was established that Sc substitution leads to much greater reduction of  M  s , as compared with Al 3+ , Cr 3+  and In 3+ , as well as to lowering of the resonance linewidth and the dielectric losses.
0	The effects of stress ratio on high-cycle fatigue (HCF) and very-high-cycle fatigue (VHCF) behavior of a Ti-6Al-4V alloy were systematically investigated in this paper. Fatigue tests with ultrasonic frequency (20 kHz) were performed on specimens of a bimodal Ti-6Al-4V alloy with stress ratios of -1, -0.5, -0.1, 0.1 and 0.5. Three types of crack initiation mode were observed on the fracture surfaces of the specimens that failed in the HCF and the VHCF regimes, which were explicitly classified as surface-without-facets, surface-with-facets and interior-with-facets. With the increase of stress ratio from 1 to 0.5, the number of specimens for surface-without-facets decreased, that for surface-with-facets increased, and that for interior-with-facets increased first and then decreased. For the failure types of surface-with-facets and interior-with-facets, the fatigue strength decreased sharply in the VHCF regime, and the S-N curve switched from an asymptote shape to a duplex shape. Then, a new model based on Poisson defect distribution was proposed to describe the effects of stress ratio on the occurrence of different failure types, i.e., the competition of alternative failure types. The observations also showed that there is a rough area at the crack initiation region for interior initiation cases, and the values of the stress intensity factor range for the rough area are within a small range, with the mean value being close to the threshold for the crack starting to grow in vacuum environment of the alloy. The estimated value of plastic zone size at the periphery of rough area is close to the average diameter of the primary cc grains of the alloy. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
0	The interaction of K with Si(100)(2 × 1)-H has been studied by using thermal desorption and electron energy loss spectroscopy. We have found that above 360 K potassium adsorption induces concomitant H2 desorption. This mechanism has been ascribed to a two step process consisting of the reaction of an incoming K atom with surface SiH species to form a surface complex, followed by the decomposition of this complex to give rise to the H2 desorption. We have found that the isolated reaction intermediate, whose decomposition leads to the H2 desorption around 450 K, is formed by the deposition of a small amount of K at 90 K. For the deposition of a large amount of K, the reaction intermediates form two types of potassium hydrides upon annealing and give rise to sharp H2 desorption peaks at 360 and 380 K. Analysis of the K uptake curves above 360 K in terms of the Kisliuk model shows that K adsorption occurs via a precursor-mediated process, which is similar to that on clean Si(100)(2 × 1) but with a much low probability (&lt; 110) for the precursor to chemisorb. We suggest that the low probability for chemisorption is due to the activation barrier, estimated to be ∼ 3 kcal/mol, for the precursor K atoms to react with surface SiH species.
0	Abstract   Redox flow batteries (RFBs) have been limited by low energy density and high cost. Here, we employ highly-soluble, inexpensive and reversible polysulfide and iodide species to demonstrate a high-energy and low-cost all-liquid polysulfide/iodide redox flow battery (PSIB). In contrast to metal-hybrid or semi-solid approaches that are usually adapted for high-energy RFBs, the all-liquid characteristic of the PSIB is crucial to enable practical scale-up development. Combining the achieved energy density (43.1 W h L−1Catholyte+Anolyte) and the inherent low materials cost of sulfur and iodine compared to vanadium, the PSIB system demonstrates a significantly lower materials cost per kilowatt hour ($85.4 kW h−1) compared to the state-of-the-art vanadium-based redox flow batteries ($152.0–154.6 kW h−1). Operando UV-Visible spectroscopy reveals superior electrochemical reversibility of both electrolytes. With its demonstrated energy density, inherent low material cost and benign chemical natures, the all-liquid PSIB offers a promising solution for high-energy-density and low-cost energy storage applications.
0	Abstract   The partial p-like electron densities of states at potassium sites in the graphite intercalation compound KC8 has been investigated by means of soft x-ray emission spectroscopy. It is demonstrated that hybridization between the potassium and graphitic valence states occurs over the 0–10 eV binding energy region. The p-like charge at the intercalated potassium sites is equivalent to 0.6 electrons per potassium atom, i.e. double the value for elemental potassium.
0	Abstract   Li 0.30 Cr 0.02 Ni 0.68 O giant dielectric ceramics doped with Al 2 O 3  were prepared by solid-state reaction via sol–gel process. The sintered samples were characterized using X-ray powder diffraction and scanning electron microscopy, and dielectric properties were also investigated. All doped samples showed the single phase of cubic rock-salt structure NiO. With increasing Al 2 O 3  content, the crystallite size and grain size decreased, possibly due to an occurrence of the secondary phases at grain boundaries which inhibit the grain growth. The sample with 0.2 wt.% Al 2 O 3  showed nearly 7 times lower tanδ (2.37) and higher e r  (7.25 × 10 6 ) measured at 1 kHz and room temperature when compared to the pure sample.
0	Abstract   The influences of microstructure, alloying additions and processing method on the flexural strength and fracture behavior of gamma base titanium aluminides were investigated at room and elevated temperatures. The flexural strength strongly depends on the microstructure, alloying addition and processing method. The lamellar microstructure material exhibited high strength and ternary chromium or niobium addition improved the strength. Isothermal forging resulted in a fine grain microstructure and influenced the bend properties. The flexural strength increased up to a ‘critical temperature’ and thereafter it decreased. This ‘critical temperature’ seemed to depend on the chemical composition. The room-temperature fracture was mostly transgranular cleavage and intergranular fracture regions were dominant with increasing temperature. At high temperatures ductile tearing was observed, irrespective of the microstructure.
0	We study theoretically the optical properties of embedded Ge and Si nanocrystals (NCs) in wide band-gap matrix and compared the obtained results for both NCs embedded in SiO2 matrix. We calculate the ground and excited electron and hole levels in both Ge and Si nanocrystals (quantum dots) in a multiband effective mass approximation. We use the envelope function approximation taking into account the elliptic symmetry of the bottom of the conduction band and the complex structure of the top of the valence band in both Si and Ge (NCs). The Auger recombination (AR) in both nanocrystals is thoroughly investigated. The excited electron (EE), excited hole (EH) and biexciton AR types are considered. The Auger recombination (AR) lifetime in both NCs has been estimated and compared.
1	Abstract   A new technique is proposed for analysis of the composition of incident hydrogen ion beams accelerated by Van de Graaff electrostatic accelerators. The procedure is based on the analysis of the energy distribution of the neutral fraction of the hydrogen ion beam by a silicon surface barrier detector. It is shown that along with the main beam components (H+, H0) at the energy E0, another component exists at the energy 0.25 E0. This component is brought about through acceleration and breakup of molecular H2+ ions. However such inhomogeneities do not play a noticeable role in formation of the low energy tail of hydrogen ions backscattered from thin self-supporting films.
1	Abstract   Self-diffusion experimental data obtained with the n.m.r. pulsed gradient spin-echo method in polyethylene oxide (PEO), polystyrene (PS), dextran, gelatine, cellulose triacetate (CT), poly(dimethyl siloxane) (PDMS) solutions and melts in a wide range of solvents, with molecular mass (M) and concentration (o), were analysed to show the existence of common dependencies for Ds(M) and Ds(o). The general law for Ds(o) is expressed as    f(  o  \    o  ) =   D     s   (o)  L(o)D     s   (0)    and is correct for the solvent quality ranging from θ to ‘good’. The existence of the generalized    f  (  o  \    o  )    was examined for the 17 different polymer-solvent systems. With the use of the generalized function, where    D     s   (O)=lim  D     s   \    o  ,D     s   (O)≈M     −β   ,  \    ≈M      −  2−β  3      nearly 100 Ds(o) dependencies were described. The renormalization function L(o) accounts for the local dynamic properties of the concentration dependence.
0	Abstract   The present paper considers the influence of the anisotropy of thermal and elastic properties of crystals on thermoelastic stresses in shaped corundum single crystals grown by the Stepanov technique. On the basis of the general principle of symmetry the forms of stress tensors are determined depending on the orientation for single crystals of different shapes. The applicability of approximate formulae for calculating the thermoelastic stresses in transparent crystals is discussed and the results of the numerical calculations are given. Factors introducing anisotropy of thermoelastic properties for rod- and ribbon-shaped crystals are introduced to obtain the quantitative characteristics of the influence of anisotropy. The values of these factors are determined from the single crystal properties and depend only on its orientation. The orientations providing minimum stress values during crystal growth under temperature conditions realized in practice, are indicated for sapphire single crystals.
0	Abstract   The thin tunneling barrier in a Nb/AlAlOx/Nb was characterized by anodization spectroscopy, SIMS and RBS. From the anodization spectroscopy we can get the film thickness from the voltage span and, most importantly, also the sharpness of the Nb/AlOx and Al/Nb interfaces around the tunneling barrier. Comparison of the anodization profiles with SIMS depth profiles and RBS spectra shows that the anodization spectroscopy can be used to characterize the junction quality.
0	Abstract   The optical fine splitting and Zeeman splitting of ZnS:Fe 2+  are explained on the basis of both the complete energy matrix diagonalization procedure (CDP) and the crystal-field-like model. The results are in good agreement with experimental data and indicate that dynamic Jahn-Teller effect does not seem to play an important role in the ground state of ZnS:Fe 2+ .
1	Abstract   A core/shell nanoparticle system with a lecithin core and a pluronic shell has been previously reported, and it was shown to act as an effective sustained release system for positively charged proteins. Here, to provide improved stability of the core/shell nanoparticle system in a physiological environment, we prepared the core/shell nanoparticle system with a photo-crosslinked shell layer by using a lecithin liposome as the core and pluronic F 127 diacrylate (DA-PF 127) as the shell layer. The DA-PF 127 was then photo-polymerized. Compared with a purely physical system, chemical crosslinking of the shell layer resulted not only in significantly increased structural stability of the core/shell nanoparticles in both an organic co-solvent and in serum but also several remarkably enhanced functioning as a protein delivery system. First, the chemically crosslinked systems were resuspended in aqueous solution after lyophilization without using a cryo-protectant. Second, target proteins were efficiently loaded into the nanoparticles by simple co-incubation in aqueous solution at a low temperature (4 °C) and the dried powder form of the protein-loaded nanoparticles was obtained. The loading capacity of the system was increased by more than 10 times compared with that of a purely physical system. Most importantly, the chemically crosslinked system showed more sustained release of the loaded proteins, and the release rate was not noticeably affected by the presence of serum proteins, whereas sustained release of loaded vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in a purely physical system was greatly reduced by serum proteins. In an in vivo corneal angiogenesis assay the chemically crosslinked system loaded with VEGF resulted in more efficient new blood vessel formation than the physical system.
0	Abstract   Pure and Eu-doped ZnS nanoparticles have been synthesized by chemical precipitation technique. Morphological study reveals the spherical nature of the synthesized nanoparticles as well as its average size to be 29–37 nm. The effect of Eu-doping on structural and optical properties of the synthesized nanoparticles has been investigated. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy confirms the stoichiometry of the synthesized nanoparticles. X-ray diffraction study reveals that the synthesized nanoparticles possess the cubic crystal structure. XRD confirms that higher doping concentration of Eu from 10 to 20% results in the formation of Eu2O3. UV–visible spectroscopy reveals that the band gap of the pure ZnS nanoparticles is 4.2 eV, which further decreases with addition of Eu, to 3.9 eV. Fourier transforms Infra-red spectroscopy shows the presence of surface passivating agent, mercaptoethanol, on the surface of the synthesized nanoparticles. Photoluminescence spectrum for pure ZnS nanoparticles has been found to be broad and asymmetric, whereas sharp peaks are observed when it was doped with Eu. There are five strong emission peaks at 574, 591, 617, 700, 754 nm have been observed in the PL spectra of the Eu-doped ZnS nanoparticles, respectively associated with 5D0→7F6, 7F4, 7F2, 7F1, 7F0 transitions. The possible mechanism of observed structural and photoluminescence has been explained on the basis of Eu-doping.
0	Abstract   The present work involves using differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) in an investigation of the thermal behaviour of hydration products in ordinary Portland cement as a function of age. The two-step loss of water from calcium silicate hydrate, dehydroxylation of calcium hydroxide, and decarbonation of calcium carbonate contribute respectively to the three major endothermic peaks in the DSC curves. Peaks due to the formation of ettringite and iron-substituted ettringite, C 4 AH 13  and Fe 2 O 3  solid solution, were also found. Some DSC observations were supplemented by X-ray diffraction analysis.
0	A range of immittance formalisms is exploited to understand the nature of conduction and polarization within Portland cement-based binders over the frequency range 1 Hz to 1 MHz. Data are presented for binders with and without aggregate additions; of particular interest was the electrical response of a binary combination of ordinary Portland cement and fly ash. Regarding the latter, when presented on a Nyquist diagram, a characteristic plateau region emerged between the electrode spur and the bulk arc. When presented in the form of dielectric constant and conductivity as a function of frequency, a region of dispersion was evident for all systems. Furthermore, it was shown that by undertaking a dielectric frequency-domain analysis of the data, the experimental results could be synthesized across the frequency range 1 kHz to 1 MHz. Rather than ascribing separate processes to each impedance zone, the observed response could be attributed to a single bulk polarization process. When transformed into the complex impedance plane, there was also good agreement between synthesized and measured response. It is postulated that polarization is as a result of double-layer effects on the grain with a relaxation frequency in the low kilohertz region.
0	Resonance Raman and photoluminescence excitation (PLE) spectroscopies are used to study the optical properties of different types of carbon nanostructures such as carbon nanotube, nanoribbons, nanographites and graphite edges. In the resonance Raman experiments of carbon nanotubes, the (n,m)(n,m) assignment is obtained by comparing the experimental and theoretical diameter and chirality dependence of the optical transitions. The influence of the environment on the optical transitions of the nanotubes is also obtained in the Raman experiments. The PLE measurements in different samples of carbon nanotubes show both direct and phonon-assisted optical transitions, and the results give new evidences that the optical transitions in nanotubes have an excitonic character, which is very strong for the low energy transitions. We also analyze the Raman spectra of nanoribbons and nanographites, showing that this technique is an important tool for defect characterization in graphitic materials, and can be used to distinguish the atomic structure of the graphite edges.
0	Abstract   Vertically aligned carbon nanotubes (CNT) have been grown in a DC-PECVD apparatus on quartz membranes. 〈1 0 0〉-oriented Si wafer has been anisotropically etched in a KOH solution. A mixture of acetylene and hydrogen gases is used to grow CNT while Ni acts as the catalyst layer. As-grown structures have been coated by titanium dioxide using chemical vapor deposition at atmospheric pressure. By means of a polishing and ashing process steps followed by total removing of the quartz membrane both ends of CNTs are opened and nano holes are obtained. SEM analysis is used to study the evolution of such nanostructures.
0	The structures of the compounds A3Mo2Cl9, A = K, NH4, Rb, Cs, Me4N; A3Mo2Br9, A = K, Rb, Cs, Me4N; Cs3Mo2I9, and Cs3W2Cl9 have been refined by Rietveld analysis of powder X-ray diffraction data. The results have been used to analyze the effect of change of the A cation on the geometry of the (M2X9)3− complex anion, which comprises two octahedra sharing a common face. The observed increase in the M-M separation with increasing size of the A cation is interpreted in terms of a balance between attractive M-M bonding forces, which draw the metals together, and strong covalent M-terminal halogen bonds which, together with elongation of (M2X9)3− due to packing effects, cause a net lengthening of M-M. In the series A3Mo2Cl9, for example, the MoMo separation increases from 2.524(8) to 2.778(8) A when the A cation changes from K to Me4N.
1	Abstract   The annealing behaviour of solution grown crystals of isotactic propylene butene-1 copolymers is studied in detail. Modifications in both position and number of the d.s.c. peaks in the thermograms of single crystal aggregates as a function of the annealing temperature, are observed and correlated with the presence of different crystalline phases. For all samples a maximum is observed when the overall apparent enthalpy of fusion is reported against the annealing temperature. The annealing temperature corresponding to the maximum is a function of the copolymer composition. The diagram is characterized by a minimum corresponding to a percentage of about 43% by wt in butene-1. The long spacing of crystal aggregates is a function of the annealing temperature. For some samples the long spacing has been correlated with the melting temperature of the crystalline phases and the equilibrium melting point calculated. For copolymer samples at high propylene content the examination of the wide-angle X-ray diffraction patterns leads to the conclusion that a certain number of butene-1 units, incorporated during the crystallization, as defects in the crystalline lattice of polypropylene, following the annealing process, are ejected in the amorphous phase.
1	Abstract   Geometrical thickness of photoelectrode is one of the important design considerations that can substantially improve the device performance in Quantum Dot Sensitized Solar cells. The present work deals with the influence of the Photoanode (PA) thickness on the photovoltaic performance of these excitonic solar cells. Optical, morphological and electrochemical properties of these films are studied using UV–Visible spectroscopy, Scanning electron microscopy and Cyclic Voltammetry. Sandwich solar cells assembled using these PAs are further characterized using Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy and Chronoamperometry to investigate the electron transfer processes occurring at the sensitized photoelectrode/Electrolyte interface. These cells are then evaluated for their photovoltaic performance using J-V characteristics. The results obtained are explained qualitatively invoking the thickness dependent parameters like Light harvesting efficiency and Electron transfer yield to establish the effect of PA thickness on the solar cell performance.
0	Abstract   A new material loss technique for the experimental determination of the free evaporation rate of a metal is presented. This technique is based on the study of tip profile changes. The tip radius variation is a consequence of the simultaneous action of free evaporation and surface self-diffusion. The rate of free evaporation is related to the tip radius evolution, so the vapor pressure and heat of evaporation can be determined by measuring in situ the radius changes with time. The method permits an easy control of the cleanliness of the surface by field electron microscopy, and should enable one to study the influence of adsorption on evaporation. The method is tested with molybdenum tips. The variation of the radius of the tips, heated in ultra-high vacuum, is determined by field electron and scanning microscope measurements. Vapor pressures and heat of evaporation values obtained are in agreement with values obtained by other techniques.
0	Abstract   The habits of single crystals of the synthetic garnets, when grown from a SiO2 contaminated PbO-PbF2 flux, are dependent on the concentration of SiO2 in the melt. Y3Ga5O12 and Y3Fe5O12 crystals have a pure {211} habit when grown from an undoped melt. The crystal habit changes smoothly from {211} to {110} to {110} ≅ {100} for Y3Ga5O12, and from {211} to {110} for Y3Fe5O12 with increasing SiO2 in the melt. Y3Al5O12 crystals change from {211} &gt; {110} to {211} or from {110} &gt; {211} to {110} with increasing SiO2 in the melt. The basic habit of Y3Al5O12 garnet is dependent on the bulk composition of the melt. Spectrochemical analysis of SiO2 doped Y3Ga5O12 crystals revealed that up to 1.3wt% Si4+ was incorporated in the crystal and similar amounts in both YIG and YA1G garnets. The total divalent metal ion (Pb2+, Ca2+, and Mg2+) concentration in the crystal charge-compensates for Si4+ to maintain electrical neutrality. Analysis and comparison of the variations in oxygen positions in garnets of various composition indicate a tetrahedral site distortion for doped crystals that leads to surface energy conditions favoring a {110} habit for Si4+ doped crystals of Y3Fe5O12 and Y3Ga5O12. On the other hand, the habit change of Y3Al5O12 is believed to be dependent on a surface-contamination mechanism.
0	Abstract   Magnetic susceptibility measurements, between 0·3 and 630°K, and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance measurements in the metallic phase are presented. In the low temperature monoclinic insulating phase a moment of 2·53±0·15 μB  is associated with each niobium impurity. Forx  x  ≤0·10 in the high temperature rutile metallic phase, the magnetic susceptibility increases with Nb concentration; The NMR results show that most of the increase is located on the V sites; no Curie-Weiss behaviour is observed. For  x  ≥0·15, in the high temperature rutile insulating phase, Curie-Weiss laws corresponding to a complete localization of the  d  electrons are obtained.
1	Abstract   Knowledge on the micro-structure of composites is important to investigate their mechanical properties such as the tensile stiffness. X-ray computer assisted tomography, often called X-ray CT scan, has been used here to characterise the micro-structure of rib weft knitted fabrics. This tomography technique provides three-dimensional images of rib weft knitted fabrics. The orientation of yarn segments is represented using second order ( a   ij  ) and fourth order ( a   ijkl  ) tensors. Micro-mechanical models with respect to the yarn orientation were used to predict the stiffness properties of rib and milano knitted fabric composites.
0	Abstract   The effect of 10 at% Cr addition to Fe-alloys containing 25 and 30 at% Al and the influence of the thermal treatment on the defect structure of these samples have been investigated by positron lifetime spectroscopy. Calculations have been performed to study the influence of Cr impurities on the lifetime associated to vacancy-type defects in both the D0 3  and B2 phases. The results show that Cr addition leads to a decrease of positron lifetime parameters associated with an increase of the D0 3  order.
1	Electron beam lithography is generally accepted to have the highest practical resolution capability. In this paper the state of the art in terms of resolution is reviewed. This covers conventional resists such as PMMA, contamination resist, inorganic resists and damage processes. Some insights into the resolution limiting factors are given although the precise limitations still remain unclear. Consideration is also given as to the best measure of resolution and it is suggested that the minimum line spacing is a more appropriate and less subjective measure than minimum achievable feature size.
0	Abstract   For the first time the positron probing of the vacancy—V-group-atom impurity complexes, which were created by γ-irradiating 60Co (Tirr.≈280 K) in the oxygen-lean n-Ge〈V〉 (V=As, Sb, or Bi), has been conducted systematically both before and after n-p-conversion of material. The one-dimensional angular correlation of the annihilation radiation (ACAR) has been registered for crystallographic directions [1 1 1], [1 1 0], and [1 0 0]. The concentration of defects in the same samples was determined from the temperature dependencies of the carrier density and mobility obtained over the range of 4.2–300 K.  It was found that (i) the trapping cross section of positrons by the radiation complexes is over the range of (0.7–4.3)×10−15 cm2, and (ii) the size of V-group-atom situated in nearest environment of the positron plays crucial role in generating elementally specific emission of the annihilation γ-quanta. The positron-sensitive vacancy—V-group-atom impurity complexes, or E centres, are formed under γ-irradiation at room temperature in oxygen-lean n-Ge〈V〉 (V=As, Sb, or Bi); this process is accompanied by removing free electrons and at higher doses of irradiation the n-p-conversion occurs. Deeply converted material of p-type contains acceptor centres whose energy levels depending on V-group-atom size are over the range of Ev+(0.1–0.16) eV. The positron annihilation data are interpreted in terms of successive trapping of vacancies by the E centres to be formed, in particular, before n-p-conversion of γ-irradiated material.
0	Abstract   The Infrared Background Signature Survey (IBSS) experiment was launched successfully in May 1991 with the US Space Shuttle Mission STS39. The retrievable satellite SPAS II carried a multitude of electro-optical sensors which covered the spectral range from ultraviolet to mid-infrared (IR). The dominating sensor was a cryogenically cooled IR telescope with two focal plane instruments equipped with Si:XX detectors operating in the wavelength range from 2.5 to 22.6 μm. Cooling of the entire sensor was achieved by a 300 dm 3  supercritical helium dewar designed and built by MBB. The design of this dewar was based largely on the work conducted by MBB within the framework of the national GIRL programme, which was eventually terminated in 1985. The IBSS mission has gathered invaluable data on the IR signatures of targets such as plumes and the Earth from space. The experience gained with the dewar during all stages of the programme has been of benefit to the current ISO programme.
0	Abstract   The goal of this work was to understand the effects of aging at 800 °C on the microstructures and mechanical properties of two recently-developed AFA stainless steels based on Fe-14Cr-32Ni-3Nb-3Al-2Ti (wt.%), one of which contained small additions of boron and carbon. To that end both the size distributions and growth kinetics of the B2, Laves phase, L12 precipitates present were quantified. While the lattice parameter, morphology, size and coarsening behavior of the L12 precipitates was the same in both AFA alloys, the B and C enhanced the grain boundary coverage by both Laves phase and B2-NiAl precipitates, but suppressed their coarsening. These interstitial additions also suppressed the formation of twins and discontinuous precipitation, which were observed in the B and C-free material. It is shown that the yield strength at 700 °C is largely controlled by the size of the L12 precipitates, with the largest strengthening effect obtained after aging for 2.4 h for both AFA alloys. Longer aging time led to a loss of strength mainly due to the coarsening of the L12 precipitates.
0	Abstract   The thermal decomposition of akaganeite, β-FeOOH, in air is studied. The structural properties of the dehydroxylation product, identified as hematite, are determined at different temperatures. From the results on crystallite size and microstrains, a change of crystallite shape has been shown to occur in the range of temperatures of 300 to 485°C. A marked increase in crystallite size and a diminution in microstrains is observed at 525°C. This change is related to the occurrence of an exothermic peak in the DTA and DSC curves of akaganeite at about 512°C. The peak is thus ascribed to a recrystallization process of hematite. Electron micrographs support the most relevant observations of changes in particle size and shape.
1	Abstract   Ceramics reinforced with continuous fibres exhibit delayed failure under pulsating load. A micromechanical model describing the fatigue effects is proposed. It is based on a decrease in shear stress at the fibre/matrix interfaces, as a result of interfacial wear caused by see-saw sliding. The main features of this model are as follows. During the first load cycle, the material exhibits multiple matrix cracking and some fibre breaks. The system is then a serial set of matrix cracks, each of them bridged by a parallel set of intact or broken fibres. During subsequent cycles the interfacial shear stress decreases, leading to an increase in the failure probability of the bridging fibres. These changes give both a reduction of stiffness and a widening of the hysteresis loops. For a critical fraction of broken bridging fibres, instability occurs and the specimen fails, thus defining the lifetime. The higher the applied load, the higher is the initial damage on the first cycle and the faster the instability condition is reached. For peak stresses that are lower, but still higher than the proportionality limit, the material also changes but no failure occurs (up to 106 cycles), indicating that the interfacial shear stress decreases to a non-zero value; this limiting value controls the fatigue limit in the lifetime diagram.
0	Abstract   Thin polymer-metal films were prepared by simultaneous plasma polymerization of tetrafluoromethane (CF 4 ) in an rf glow discharge and evaporation of gold. By controlling the deposition parameters various amounts of gold could be incorporated in the polymer matrix giving a wide range of sheet resistances. The gauge factors of these films were found to be substantially lower than vacuum evaporated gold films for the sheet resistance range studied. It is suggested that this behaviour may be consequence of a meandering three-dimensional path in the case of polymer-metal films in contrast with a meandering two-dimensional path in the case of evaporated metal films.
1	Abstract   Osmotic pressure measurements on polystyrene (   M     n    = 396. 000   ) in  trans -decalin for concentrations up to 140 kg m −3  and from 20 to 40 are reported. The θ-temperature is 20.8 . The ratio      ∂(  π  c  )  ∂c     c=0   ∂(  π  c  )  ∂c      c=c     +         where c +  is the concentration at which a homogeneous segment distribution is assumed to prevail, increases with temperature up to the plateau value of 0.7. From the temperature dependence of the osmotic pressure, the partial molar enthalpy.  Δh  1 , and entropy,  Δs  1 . of mixing are found to be positive. The solvent-solute interaction parameter increases linearly with concentration at all temperatures.
0	Abstract   Computer simulation of the reflection of a keV ion beam from a single crystal is carried out for different target temperatures. Ar ions bombarding obliquely a Cu lattice with 2 keV, and a Ni crystal with 30 keV energy are considered. The potentials used are of Born-Mayer ( A e −r/b ) and Firsov ( Br  −2 ) type respectively. Uncorrelated thermal vibrations of atoms with Gaussian distribution of their displacements are taken into account. The spatial and energy distribution of the reflected ions obtained for different temperatures are discussed. The energy spectra are compared with the experimental data for the same conditions.
0	Abstract   In this investigation, a pre-formed, autoclaved porous material, of stable pore characteristic, was used to study the freezing characteristics of wet porous materials. Prior to freezing, prisms made from this material were filled with solutions of air-entraining agents. The results show that (i) a major part of a solution could be frozen without any dilation of the matrix, (ii) the dilation, when it occurs, is connected with the later stages of the freezing process when only a limited amount of ice forms, (iii) initially, ice forms on the surfaces of large air-filled pores, (iv) ice formation strengthens the matrix.  It is proposed that the initially formed ice-layers on the pore surfaces seal in the remainder of the solutions. Continued ice formation generates a bursting pressure within the unfrozen solution. When this bursting pressure exceeds the tensile strength of the ice-strengthened matrix, it fails.  Attention has been drawn to the relevance of the above observations and the hypothesis to freezing of cement paste.
0	Abstract   Ca 2 GeO 4  of olivine form has been found to transform at 900°C and 110 kbars to K 2 NiF 4  type, with  a  = 3.70,  c  = 11.88 A, and with a corresponding density increase of 25%. The geochemical significance of this transformation is discussed, and a comparison of the molar volumes of olivines, spinels and other structure type with the volumes of their isochemical mixtures of simple oxides or fluorides is used to obtain relative molar volumes for a large number of dense M 3 O 4  structure types.
1	Abstract   The technique of  119m Sn Mossbauer spectroscopy has been used to study the changes which occur in three organotin stabilisers within a PVC matrix when exposed to doses of γ-irradiation up to 20 Mrad. The stabilisers studied were dioctyltinbis(iso-octylthioglycollate) [Oct 2 Sn( IOTG ) 2 ], dibutyltinbis(iso-octylthioglycollate) [Bu 2 Sn(IOTG) 2 ] and dibutyltinbis(iso-octylmaleate) [Bu 2 Sn(IOM) 2 ] incorporated into the PVC at the appropriate commercial level by conventional hot milling techniques or solvent casting. Extended doses up to 20 Mrad showed that the final degradation product for all three stabilisers is SnCl 4  and that the rate of degradation depends not only upon the type of stabiliser but also upon the extent of thermo-mechanical damage suffered by the PVC during processing. Mossbauer spectra were recorded at intermediate doses in the range 0·1 to 10 Mrad and yielded complex spectra containing unresolved lines corresponding to mixtures of original stabilisers and degradation products. Intermediate degradation products are proposed and rapid conversion to SnCl 4  is observed to start at doses greater than 3 Mrad.
0	This paper describes the effects of dissolved carbon dioxide on the electrochemical reactions of two pipeline steels: a low alloy steel and a 13% Cr stainless steel. The dissolved gas reacts with the iron component of these steels in such a way as to contribute to their depassivation. The mechanism proposed is that of complexing with Fe (II) within the hydroxide film to give both ferrous carbonate and a dissolved complex. The effect is negligible for the 13% Cr stainless steel, but contributes to the corrosion of the low alloy steel. The cathodic regime representing evolution of hydrogen is also affected by the presence of dissolved carbon dioxide. At low cathodic overpotentials this appears to arise from a pH buffering action. At high cathodic overpotentials there is some evidence that the carbon component of the dissolved CO2 is reduced, probably to carbon monoxide, and this reduces the rate of hydrogen evolution by cathode poisoning. The roles of pH buffer and of electrolytic anion are discussed.
0	Abstract   A magnesium-zirconium alloy, in which the zirconium has been precipitated as zirconium hydride, has been examined in creep at 400–450 °C. Denuded zones are shown to form at grain boundaries normal to the applied stress and the size of these zones can account for the entire creep strain. The strain rate vs stress relationship is such, however, that the zones cannot be formed by diffusion creep. The published evidence purporting to show the importance of diffusion-creep in magnesium alloys at 450 °C is reviewed and, apart from the metallographic observations, i.e. the formation of the zones, is shown to be negligible.
0	Abstract   The Saab-Scania Aircraft Company has manufactured aircraft for the Swedish Air Force since 1940, starting with the B-18 Bomber. Other famous aircraft are the J29 ‘Flying Barrel’, the J35 ‘Draken’ (today in service in Sweden, Denmark, Finland and soon in Austria) and the ‘Viggen’ family. In the beginning of the 1990s the multi-role combat aircraft JAS39 ‘Griffon’ will be delivered to the Swedish Air Force. Saab-Scania also have a leading market position in the commuter airplane segment of 30–40 passengers, Saab 340.  At a request of the Swedish Defence Material Administration, Saab-Scania 1975 started a programme introducing new materials for aircraft production. This resulted in redesigning of some metal parts by using carbon fibre composite.  The programme gave a soft start in using the new material but has given a broad experience in both manufacturing and service areas. This experience is being used when developing new military and civil products.
0	Abstract   Within the framework of a review of the fundamental processes applied for the manufacture of ammonium paratungstate (APT) the main byproducts and wastes generated in these processes and their environmental impact are summarized.  A subsidiary process based on the electrodialytic recovery of NaOH for the elimination of the salt byproduct, which is generated in the largest quantities, is outlined together with the main aspects to be taken into account for large-scale industrial implementation.  The present stage of development and implementation of an APT production line for the processing of typical scrap material from the light filament industry is shown, as well as the oxidizing and dissolving process of compact and lumpy tungsten alloy scrap (CuW, FeNiW) and hard metal scrap (CoWC, CoWCTa(Nb)CTiC).  Several as yet unexploited potentials are sketched which could, from scientific and engineering standpoints, be interesting for the development of more efficient intermediate manufacturing processes for APT and tungsten or process operation for a wide variety of raw materials.
1	Abstract   The changes of cross-sectional area and refractive-index profile of ‘Terylene’ polyester fibres after stretching have been studied. The cross-sectional shape is determined from the diffraction pattern of a HeNe laser beam. Multiple-beam Fizeau fringes in transmission are used to determine the refractive index profile of these fibres at different draw ratios. A microstrain device connected to a wedge interferometer is utilized for this purpose. Microinterferograms are given for illustration.
1	We constructed the PDEODE (Predict-Discuss-Explain-Observe-Discuss-Explain) teaching strategy, a variant of the classical POE (Predict-Observe-Explain) activity, to promote conceptual change, and investigated its effectiveness on student understanding of the evaporation concept. The sample consisted of 52 first year students in a primary science education department. The students’ ideas were revealed by a test consisting of eight questions. The PDEODE teaching strategy was designed on the basis of the students’ preconceptions. Conceptual change in students’ understanding of evaporation was evaluated by administering the same test as pre-, post and delayed post-test. The test scores were analyzed by both qualitative and quantitative methods. Statistical analysis using general linear model repeated measures of student test scores point to statistically significant differences in pre-, post-, delayed post tests and total scores (p&lt;0.05), suggesting that the strategy helped students to achieve a better conceptual understanding. Further, no statistically significant differences were observed between post-test and delayed post-test scores, suggesting that teaching strategy enabled students to retain their new conceptions in their long-term memory.
1	Covering: the literature up to 2003The present article highlights selected instances of the formulation of biogenetic schemes which over the past half century have contributed to our current understanding of the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites. These are mostly formed from a small number of primary precursors, which can often be identified by structural analysis. Representative examples of the role of speculation are discussed with particular emphasis on homo- and heterocyclic polyketides and amino acid derived products.
0	Rate constants are calculated for the addition reaction of the light hydrogen isotope muonium (Mu) to oxygen and compared with the analogous additions of H and D and with experimental results. The origin and magnitude of kinetic isotope effects is discussed. Both the pressure dependence and the temperature dependence in different pressure regimes are analysed with the goal to check the applicability of statistical reaction theories to these systems. Two different theories are applied. One is based on approximations as introduced by Troe (J.Chem.Phys., 1977, 66, 4758; J.Phys.Chem., 1979, 83, 114; and J.Phys.Chem., 1981, 75, 226), while in the second one, the master equation is solved numerically. The microcanonical rate constants going into the master equation are calculated using RRKM theory, and for the activation/deactivation as a consequence of collisions with moderator (N2), an exponential energy transfer mechanism is assumed. Comparison with low pressure experiments leads to the conclusion that collisions of the moderator with highly excited MuO2* molecules are much less efficient than those with HO2*, as far as activation/deactivation is concerned. This result may be explained by the larger vibrational frequencies of MuO2*. The linear dependence with the moderator concentration of the Mu rate constants up to 300 bar, as observed in the experiment, could partly be simulated, but some discrepancy remains. In this context, the possibility of non-RRKM behaviour is discussed. Finally, the major influence of tunneling, especially for the light Mu atom, is analysed. It is suggested that the effect of tunneling near the low pressure limit may exceed significantly its high pressure limiting value.
0	The physics program of the High Acceptance Di-Electron Spectrometer HADES at GSI is largely motivated by the aim to study medium modifications of hadrons predicted by many theoretical approaches, as well as by the need to shed light on the still unexplained results of the former DLS experiment. In this contribution the HADES experiment is outlined and first results obtained in  12 C+ 12 C collisions at 2 AGeV are presented.

1	This paper provides a two-dimensional fluctuation splitting scheme for unsteady hyperbolic problems which achieves third-order accuracy in both space and time. For a scalar conservation law, the sufficient conditions for a stable fluctuation splitting scheme to achieve a prescribed order of accuracy in both space and time are derived. Then, using a quadratic space approximation of the solution over each triangular element, based on the reconstruction of the gradient at the three vertices, and a four-level backward discretization of the time derivative, an implicit third-order-accurate scheme is designed. Such a scheme is extended to the Euler system and is validated versus well-known scalar-advection problems and inviscid discontinuous flows.
1	In this paper, we develop a coupled immersed boundary (IB) and immersed interface method (IIM) to simulate the electrodeformation and electrohydrodynamics of a vesicle in Navier-Stokes leaky dielectric fluids under a DC electric field. The vesicle membrane is modeled as an inextensible elastic interface with an electric capacitance and an electric conductance. Within the leaky dielectric framework and the piecewise constant electric properties in each fluid, the electric stress can be treated as an interfacial force so that both the membrane electric and mechanical forces can be formulated in a unified immersed boundary method. The electric potential and transmembrane potential are solved simultaneously via an efficient immersed interface method. The fluid variables in Navier-Stokes equations are solved using a projection method on a staggered MAC grid while the electric potential is solved at the cell center. A series of numerical tests have been carefully conducted to illustrate the accuracy and applicability of the present method to simulate vesicle electrohydrodynamics. In particular, we investigate the prolate-oblate-prolate (POP) transition and the effect of electric field and shear flow on vesicle electrohydrodynamics. Our numerical results are in good agreement with those obtained in previous work using different numerical algorithms.
1	Abstract   The arterial endothelium exquisitely regulates vascular function, and endothelial dysfunction plays a critical role in the development of atherosclerosis. Atherosclerotic lesions develop preferentially at arterial branches and bifurcations where the blood flow is disturbed. Understanding the basis for this observation requires elucidating the effects of blood flow on the endothelial cell (EC) function. The goal of this review is: (1) to describe our current understanding of the relationships between arterial blood flow and atherosclerosis, (2) to present the wide array of flow-induced biological responses in ECs, and (3) to discuss the mechanisms by which ECs sense, transmit, and transduce flow-derived mechanical forces. We conclude by presenting some future perspectives in the highly interdisciplinary field of EC mechanotransduction.
1	Abstract   We calculate the heat flow from the depth of bottom-simulating seismic reflectors (BSRs) on a seismic profile in the Xisha Trough of the South China Sea, and compare them with the probe heat flow measurements. The BSR heat flow turn out to be 32–80 mW/m2, significantly lower than the measurements of 83–112 mW/m2. Such big disparity cannot be ascribed only to the errors from parameters (parameter errors) that traditionally believed to influence the BSR heat flow. Besides the parameter errors, we discuss emphatically the errors coming from the theoretical assumption for the BSR heat flow determination (theoretical errors), which occur when the BSR depth does not coincide with the base of the methane hydrate stability zone (MHSZ). If BSR stays bellow the base of MHSZ, lying at the top of free gas zone, the derived heat flow would be underestimated. Compared with the parameter errors, the theoretical errors would be relatively larger in some geological settings. The disparity between measured and BSR heat flow in the Xisha Trough might be mainly due to the theoretical error. Based on the theoretical model, assuming that the BSR lying at the top of the free gas zone, the methane flux along the Xisha seismic profile is estimated, and the thickness of the methane hydrate occurrence zone is predicted.
0	Abstract   SHRIMP U–Pb zircon ages were obtained from the Aguablanca mineralized gabbro and the Santa Olalla Igneous Complex. These ages fix the timing of Variscan magmatism and Ni–Cu–PGE mineralizing processes in the Ossa Morena Zone, SW Iberia. This complex has a special relevance as it hosts the Aguablanca deposit, the most important Ni–Cu–PGE mineralization in SW Europe. Two samples were taken to select zircons for cathodoluminescence studies and ion-microprobe dating. One sample was made up of mineralized gabbro (with ca. 5% sulphides, mainly pyrrhotite, chalcopyrite and pentlandite) from the central part of the Aguablanca mine. The other was a granodiorite from the central part of the Santa Olalla plutonic complex. SHRIMP-zircon dating indicates protolith ages of the Aguablanca gabbro of 344 ± 2.1 Ma, in agreement with the age of 347 ± 3.4 Ma for the Santa Olalla granodiorite. The results demonstrate that emplacement of the Aguablanca gabbro and the Santa Olalla plutonic complex took place in the same Variscan geodynamic setting during the Lower Carboniferous, probably related to formation of the mantle-plume derived Iberseis Reflective Body (IRB) and subsequent Visean transpressional deformation.

The gold mineralization is hosted by Neoproterozoic–Cambrian schists, and is controlled by nearly parallel E–W trending bedding-concordant fracture zones. The Au orebodies are composed of auriferous quartz veins and altered rocks, with the Au grades ranging from 2.23 g/t to 69.56 g/t, and containing   The  δ  34 S values of 18 separates of sulfides from auriferous quartz veins show a large variation from − 0.2 to + 16.8‰. The lead isotope compositions of sulfides from the gold ore are characterized by highly radiogenic values and very wide ranges of ratios: 18.324 to 20.819 for  206 Pb/ 204 Pb, 15.679 to 15.856 for  207 Pb/ 204 Pb, and 38.401 to 41.204 for  208 Pb/ 204 Pb. These data indicate that lead and sulfur in the quartz veins have multiple sources, and were derived from the different wall rocks as the fluid flowed through them.  Fluid inclusions indicate that the ore fluid was CO 2 -rich, with salinities mainly between 1 and 6 wt.%  NaCl equiv, and homogenization temperatures predominantly ranging from 260 to 280 °C. The  δ  18 O values for quartz from auriferous veins range from 13.7 to 16.3‰, and the calculated  δ  18 O H2O  values in equilibrium with quartz vary from 5.54 to 9.48‰. It suggests that the ore fluid may be derived from deep, metamorphic deep-crustal gold-transporting fluids, although a contribution from magmatic source cannot be ruled out.   40 Ar/ 39 Ar age dating on the sericite from the alteration associated with the auriferous quartz veins in the Mayum gold deposit gives a plateau-like age of 59.34 ± 0.62 Ma, later than the onset of the Indo-Asian collision. It is believed the gold mineralization was related to the Indo-Asian collision, and was formed during the early stage of orogenesis.
1	Abstract   In the western Yangtze Block, southwest China, there are many hydrothermal native copper ore deposits and Zn–Pb ore deposits. All of these hydrothermal ore deposits are spatially associated with the Permian Emeishan flood basalts (EFBs), although they are much younger than the EFB. The maximum time interval between the hydrothermal ore deposits and the EFB is over 100 Ma. During this time interval, there is no documented magmatism in this region, and many studies indicate that magmatic fluids played important roles in the formations of these deposits. Thus, the origin of these hydrothermal deposits has long been controversial. In this study, we present a model that considers the underplated Emeishan basalts at the base of the crust as the main source of the ore-forming metals and fluids and present thermal simulation results of the evolution of the underplated Emeishan basalt. The results indicate that the underplated basalts begin to release metal-bearing fluid at 30 Ma after the onset of the underplating, consistent with age data of the oldest hydrothermal deposits in this region, such as the Huize Pb–Zn and native Cu ore deposits. The simulation results also indicate that the releasing ore-forming fluid from the crystallising underplated basalts can last over 100 Ma, which almost covers the entire age data available for the hydrothermal deposits, and thus successfully demonstrates the lack of temporal association between the hydrothermal deposits and the EFB. The model is developed primarily for the origin of the hydrothermal mineralisation in the SYG province, but it has general applicability to other sediment-hosted Pb–Zn deposits around the world.
0	Abstract   PYRITE is ubiquitous throughout the massive sulfide deposits of the Bathurst Mining Camp, Canada. Pyrite locally preserves primary, pseudo-primary textures, as well as secondary textures, that formed in response to the hydrothermal, metamorphic, and deformation processes to which the host sequence was exposed. In the Bathurst Mining Camp most forms of pyrite are arsenian (up to 3.13 wt% As), with considerable enrichment in Tl, Sb, Sn, Bi, Ag, Se, and to a lesser extent Cd, Ga, Te, Hg, Ge, In, and Au. LA-ICP-MS analyses of primary pyrite show significant enrichment in fluid-mobile elements, in particular, Tl, Sb, As, and Hg, as well as Bi, Pb, and Sn. In contrast, secondary pyrite (syn-to post-deformation varieties) is not enriched in these elements. Superimposed metamorphism typically causes loss of fluid-mobile elements to different degrees, except for Se.  Pyrite chemical variations have the potential to monitor ore petrogenesis at inter- and intra-deposit scales. Pyrite from the Cu-zone is enriched in Se relative to pyrite from Zn-Pb zone, in which Tl is elevated. Throughout the host sequence fluid-mobile element concentrations of pyrite vary by several orders magnitude, with the highest fluid-mobile element abundances in footwall rocks immediately proximal to the deposit. Moreover, elevated fluid-mobile element concentrations of pyrite are recognized in footwall felsic volcanic and sedimentary rocks as much as several hundred metres away from the deposit. Hanging-wall zones contain pyrite with fluid-mobile element contents comparable to pyrite from sulfide horizon. The fluid-mobile element concentrations of pyrite are higher in exhalative sedimentary rocks than pyrite from the sulfide mineralization itself.  The spatial variation in fluid-mobile element concentrations in pyrite as identified using LA-ICP-MS can be used to identify otherwise cryptic deposit-related haloes. Ultimately, this technique, when combined with traditional exploration tools, can be used to vector toward VMS mineralization in the Bathurst Mining Camp and possibly a useful indicator in a prospect-scale base metal exploration.
1	Abstract   In Northern Ireland, as elsewhere in Europe, attempts to reduce the societal impacts of severe convective storms are constrained by underestimations in frequency and intensity of extreme events within the present-day climate regime. Such underestimations also present difficulties in estimating probabilities of extreme storm frequency and intensity in relation to future climate change scenarios. Detailed analyses of past extreme events enhance the robustness of hydrometeorological and climatological models, and improve human perception of the true nature of present climate. In Northern Ireland, extensive thunderstorm development is infrequent due to relatively low relief and limited severe convectional activity in summer. On 25–26 July 1985 extensive thunderstorm activity occurred accompanied by hailstones 3 cm in diameter, some of the largest on record to fall over the Province. The event predates operation of the Northern Ireland component of the UK rainfall radar network. Nevertheless, utilizing quality-controlled autographic rain gauge records and radiosonde data, the synoptic situation was examined and the mesoscale precipitation signatures determined throughout the duration of thunderstorm activity. Within the cyclonic circulation covering Northern Ireland for much of the day, potential instability existed at three levels and on release the buoyant upward motion resulted in clouds of more than 11 km in depth. While upland areas recorded 30 to 50 mm, the greatest precipitation totals of up to 85 mm were received in lowland areas around Lough Neagh. Several lowland sites recorded rainfall totals and intensities with frequencies of about 1 in 100 years. Significant thunderstorm activity occurred over a period of 11 h and resulted in serious flooding. Observed mesoscale precipitation patterns displayed limited evidence of orographic enhancement within the moist southeast to south airflow. At best, orography assisted in terms of initial uplift, but thereafter precipitation distribution was reliant upon thunderstorm cell structure and movement with input from local site and exposure influences. A factor possibly reducing the potential for marked orographic enhancement was the absence of strong winds at low levels. Mesoscale precipitation patterns suggested enhancement locally around the west and north shores of Lough Neagh. Energy exchanges between the Lough surface and the overlying atmosphere may have had repercussions upon water vapour content and buoyancy within the cyclonic south to southeasterly airflow, leading to this precipitation enhancement. Occurrence in the Mournes of hailstones 3 cm in diameter was indicative of the strength and endurance of the updraught component within individually propagating cells. The remarkable amounts and high intensities of rainfall, accompanied by large hailstone development, emphasized the importance of the synoptic event within the climatological history of Northern Ireland. With an absence of notable orographic enhancement of precipitation, the event also highlighted the occurrence of deviations from the mean precipitation patterns normally expected within cyclonic circulations.
1	This paper presents a kinematic and microphysical study of the MAP-IOP3 orographic precipitation event performed with radar observations and Meso-NH numerical simulations. Studies relying on both observations and mesoscale model simulations are of great interest for achieving a better understanding of intense precipitation events. Despite some slight discrepancies between radar observations and numerical outputs in the present work, both emphasize the same phenomena. The merging of two convective cells, which is an important mechanism to locally enhance precipitation is shown. Beyond Meso-NH outputs and radar observations similarities, the Meso-NH model completes and precises qualitative conclusions inferred from radar observations. In particular, it permits to identify and quantify the microphysical processes involved in the triggering and development of the orographic precipitation. The computation of hydrometeor mixing ratio and microphysical budgets highlights the convective nature of the IOP3 precipitation, which is characterized by efficient microphysical mechanisms such as heavy riming, warm coalescence, and melting of heavy particles (graupel and hail). More precisely, the initiation of the system is associated with warm microphysics whereas the development of the system and enhancement of rain involve graupel and hail.
1	During four winters when cloud seeding took place, precipitation samples were collected at three stations in the catchment area of the Sea of Galilee (target stations) and in one station west of the seeding line (control station). Chemical analyses were carried out on more than 4000 rain samples in order to determine the major and trace metal compositions and enrichment factors of Ag (EF) with respect to Al, where Al is used as a tracer for natural dust. In addition, satellite images were analyzed to characterize the cloud phase and the temperature of the tops of the rain clouds using the EUMETSAT second generation geostationary satellite.#R##N##R##N#Our results show that the seeding agent (AgI) arrives to the target stations, as indicated by significantly higher EFAg values of Ag there compared to the control station. Furthermore, we found higher EFAg values in precipitation samples from mixed-phase clouds compared to precipitation from warm or fully glaciated clouds. This difference was observed only at the target stations. Therefore, our results are consistent with the hypothesis that AgI contributes actively to precipitation formation processes in mixed-phase clouds, where ice content is controlled by ice nuclei (IN) concentration. This is in accordance with the conventional wisdom that AgI should be mostly active in such clouds, but not in clouds that are already naturally glaciated or in warm clouds, and it supports previous statistical studies which claimed that cloud seeding enhanced rainfall in Northern Israel.
1	Abstract   The relationship between the MISR multi-angle observations of sun glint pattern width over ocean and the near-surface wind speed is explored. With this relationship, we develop an algorithm that can constrain the standard, wind-driven glint/white cap model that defines the ocean–surface boundary condition in MISR aerosol retrievals. The key geometric factor determining wind retrieval quality is the angular distance between the reflection vector and the closest MISR multi-angle observation — the minimum Sun Glint Angle (SGA).  MISR-retrieved winds are within 2.4 m/s of buoy-measured values for minimum SGA below about 15° for the 38 cases studied, and usually better than 1.1 m/s, except one for which the wind speed was extremely low. For minimum SGA above about 15°, MISR angular glint pattern reflectance sampling is not adequate to perform wind retrievals. An ambiguity in the retrieval that can occur for minimum SGA greater than 6° or 7° is resolved by the minimum observed absolute reflectance. We also confirm the high accuracy of the Cox–Munk ocean surface reflectance model, used to analyze the glint pattern dependence on wind speed. The wind-retrieval method could be used in an operational multi-angle aerosol retrieval algorithm to dynamically constrain the ocean surface boundary condition when glint pattern angular sampling is adequate.
1	Abstract   A crop yield estimation model using time-series MODIS WDRVI was developed. The main feature of the proposed model is the incorporation of crop phenology detection using MODIS data, called the “Shape-Model Fitting Method”. MODIS WDRVI taken 7–10 days before the corn silking stage had strong linear correlation with corn final grain yield at both field and regional scales. The model revealed spatial patterns of corn final grain yield all over the U.S. from 2000 to 2011. State-level corn yield was estimated accurately with coefficient of variation below 10% especially for the 18 major corn producing states including Iowa, Illinois, Delaware, Minnesota, Ohio, West Virginia, Wisconsin, Michigan, Indiana, Nebraska, Kentucky, New York, South Dakota, Missouri, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, New Jersey and Maryland. The results corresponded well with the spatial pattern of high-yield regions derived from the USDA/NASS data. However, the model tended to underestimate corn grain yield in three irrigated regions: the Midwestern region depending on the Ogallala Aquifer, the downstream basin of the Mississippi, and the southwestern region of Georgia. In contrast, it tended to overestimate corn grain yield around the outlying regions of the U.S. Corn Belt, specifically, the East Coast, North Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Missouri. The estimation accuracy of the proposed model differed depending on the region. However, the annual variation of state level corn grain yield could be detected with high accuracy, especially in the major corn producing states.
1	Abstract   A global dataset based on the ECMWF Re-Analyses (ERA) is presented that can be used as surface boundary conditions for ocean models with sea-ice components. The definition of these conditions is based on bulk formulae. To study the mean ocean circulation, a mean annual cycle on a daily basis was constructed from ERA for all relevant parameters including wind stress. Continental runoff is considered by using information about the catchment areas of the rivers and about the main drainage basins. The bulk formulae were extended by using sea ice concentration.  To estimate meridional heat transports (MHT) and to avoid any drift in ocean model simulations, the heat and fresh water budgets have been closed by applying an inverse procedure to fine-tune the fluxes towards observed transports. To improve the MHTs on the Southern Hemisphere the winds and the short wave radiation at southern higher latitudes should be corrected. Furthermore, tests were performed concerning short wave radiation which was increased in the tropics and decreased in the subsidence zones.  The heat and fresh water fluxes are assessed by using a scheme of Macdonald and Wunsch based on hydrographic sections. The net heat fluxes of ERA and of the forcing dataset are consistent with the heat flux divergences and convergences estimated by this scheme except for parts of the South Atlantic and the Indian Ocean sector of the Southern Ocean where none of these datasets is consistent with these estimates. In the subtropical South Indian Ocean the forcing dataset is consistent with these estimates while ERA are not. The flux components of ERA and the forcing dataset were compared to several observational datasets (SRB, SOC, HOAPS, GPCP, and CMAP). For each component, at least one of these datasets (especially HOAPS) supports the effects of the inverse procedure and the bulk formulae almost globally with some regional exceptions: short wave radiation in the tropical oceans and the subtropical North Atlantic, latent heat flux at higher latitudes, and precipitation in the northern North Atlantic.  Comparisons to the NCAR/NCEP Re-Analyses (NRA) (versions 1 and 2) and the ECHAM model in place of ERA lead to similar results. In the North Atlantic the net heat fluxes of the model based datasets approach the hydrographic estimate with increasing resolution. Applied to any ocean/sea-ice model and compared to ERA, the forcing dataset would induce only a relative small net sea-surface buoyancy loss.  A comparison of the forcing dataset to measurements made using one buoy deployed in the western Pacific warm pool and five buoys deployed in the subduction region of the Northeast Atlantic shows that at the site of the first buoy the net heat fluxes of the forcing dataset are in poorer agreement than those of ERA. At the sites of two subduction buoys both datasets show the same level of agreement within the error bars specified. At the sites of the three remaining subduction buoys the forcing dataset shows a marginal improvement on ERA.
1	Abstract   We present equivalent width maps of the 1.98 and 2.13 μm SO2 ice absorption bands on the surface of Io. The data were taken on 17 April 2006 with the near-infrared mapping spectrometer, OSIRIS at the W.M. Keck Observatory, Hawaii. The maps show significant regional enhancements of SO2 ice over the Bosphoros, Media, Tarsus and Chalybes Regiones.
1	Abstract   The Earth's cumulative meteoroid flux, as found by Halliday et al. (1996), may have a shallower slope for meteoroid masses in the range 0.1–2.5 kg compared to those with masses greater than 2.5 kg when plotted on a log flux vs. log mass graph. This would indicate a lack of low-mass objects. While others such as  Ceplecha (1992)  find no shallow slope, there may be a reason for a lack of 0.1–2.5 kg meteoroids which supports Halliday et al.’s finding. Simple models show that a few centimeters of space erosion in stony meteoroids can reproduce the bend in Halliday et al.’s curve at ∼2.5 kg and give the shallower slope.
1	This paper discusses and summarizes post-1994 US and European information on ammonia ðNH3Þ emissions from swine farms and assesses the applicability for general use in the United States. The emission rates for the houses calculated by various methods show good agreement and suggest that the houses are a more significant source than previously thought. A general emission factor for houses of 3:771: 0k g NH 3=year=finisher pig or 59710 g NH3=kg live weight/year is recommended. For lagoons, it was found that there is good similarity between the field test results and the number calculated by a mass balance method. The suggested annual NH3 emission factor for lagoons based on field tests at one swine farm lagoon in North Carolina is 2: 4k g=year=pig: Emission rates from sprayfields were estimated using a total mass balance approach, while subtracting the house and lagoon emissions. The total emission rates for finishing pigs at the test farm compared well to the total rate established by a mass balance approach based on nitrogen intake and volatilization. Therefore, it was concluded that a mass balance approach can be helpful in estimating NH3 emissions from swine farms. A general emission factor of 77 2k g NH3=pig=year could be developed, which is comparable to general European emission factors, which varied from 4.8 to 6: 4k g NH 3=pig=year: r 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

1	Abstract   A new method is presented to analyse the isotopic abundance of organic matter in aerosols. The method involves water extraction of aerosol filters, elution through an ion retardation resin to remove inorganic components and lyophilising the eluent to concentrate the fraction prior to isotopic analysis. Results of analyses of a series of aerosol samples collected in the UK, for the fraction of organic matter passing through the resin, are presented. Carbon and nitrogen isotopic abundances ranged from −23.0‰ to −35.5‰ (versus PDB) and −14.6‰ to +12.5‰ (versus AIR), respectively.
1	Abstract   It has been shown that the atmospheric pathways including dry deposition are an important source of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) entering surface waters in many locations. To assess how important this pathway is, accurate measurements or modeled estimates of dry deposition are needed. However, dry deposition is not well quantified because the direct measurement of dry deposition is difficult and indirect estimation techniques have substantial uncertainties associated with them. In this study, PCB dry deposition fluxes were directly measured with a water surface sampler (WSS) simultaneously with measurements of airborne concentrations in the Chicago urban area. The average particulate phase PCB flux to the WSS was 240±160 ng/m 2 -d, and the particulate phase airborne concentrations was 0.08±0.05 ng/m 3 . Average overall dry deposition velocities, calculated by dividing the fluxes by total particle phase PCB concentrations were 4.2±2.7 cm/s. This number is consistent with values determined using similar experimental techniques and higher than the values typically used to model PCB dry deposition. This difference may be due, in part, to the influence of PCBs associated with large particles being deposited onto the WSS.
1	A Bioaerosol sensing instrument referred to as WIBS-4, designed to continuously monitor ambient bioaerosols on-line, has been used to record a multiparameter “signature” from each of a number of Primary Biological Aerosol Particulate (PBAP) samples found in air. These signatures were obtained in a controlled laboratory environment and are based on the size, asymmetry (“shape”) and auto-fluorescence of the particles.#R##N##R##N#Fifteen samples from two separate taxonomic ranks (kingdoms), Plantae (×8) and Fungi (×7) were individually introduced to the WIBS-4 for measurement along with two non-fluorescing chemical solids, common salt and chalk. Over 2000 individual-particle measurements were recorded for each sample type and the ability of the WIBS spectroscopic technique to distinguish between chemicals, pollen and fungal spore material was examined by identifying individual PBAP signatures. The results obtained show that WIBS-4 could potentially be a very useful analytical tool for distinguishing between natural airborne PBAP samples, such as the fungal spores and may potentially play an important role in detecting and discriminating the toxic fungal spore, Aspergillus fumigatus, from others in real-time.#R##N##R##N#If the sizing range of the commercial instrument was customarily increased and permitted to operate simultaneously in its two sizing ranges, pollen and spores could potentially be discriminated between. The data also suggest that the gain setting sensitivity on the detector would also have to be reduced by a factor &gt;5, to routinely detect, in-range fluorescence measurements for pollen samples.
1	This study investigates the chemical speciation of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) collected at three sites in the Venice area, eastern Po Valley (Italy). This area is one of the few hot spots left in Europe where levels of PM2.5 frequently breach EU target values and cause a serious risk for public health. Elemental composition, inorganic ions and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon concentrations were quantified in 448 PM2.5 samples and the multiple-site PMF receptor model was based on the elemental and inorganic ion data. Six factors associated with potential sources were quantified, namely, secondary sulfate, ammonium nitrate and combustions, fossil fuels, traffic, industrial and glassmaking. Source apportionment results were further processed using a series of chemometric tools for returning additional information about the seasonal and spatial changes of factors extracted by the PMF analysis. In addition, PMF results were also studied in combination with weather conditions and PAH concentrations revealing that sources of secondary nitrate and sulfate are homogeneously distributed throughout the area, while remaining pollutant sources may have a distinct origin. PMF results were cluster analyzed to sort out samples with similar source profiles and then the wind roses of grouped samples were examined to assess the role of wind speed and direction on PM2.5 pollution and chemistry. The tested tools and the results obtained can be used for air quality assessment studies and air pollution reduction strategies.
1	We analyze the notion of “field-field” cross correlations associated with scattered coda waves or clutter, observed at pairwise distinct receivers, to obtain an “empirical” Green’s function (EGF) with an emphasis on high-frequency body waves. The scattered waves are generated in a slab with random medium fluctuations by an incident wave packet below. Following the dyadic parabolic scaling of wave packets, and scaling the random fluctuations appropriately, we arrive at a description in terms of a system of ˆ¨ odinger di usion models. Studying the Wigner distributions of the fields generated by these models, leads to a “blurring” transformation providing a complete characterization of the mentioned cross correlations. We analyze the notion of “field-field” cross correlations associated with scattered coda waves, observed at pairwise distinct receivers, to obtain an “empirical” Green’s function (EGF) with an emphasis on highfrequency body wave reflections. As a model configuration, we consider a slab in which random medium fluctuations occur. The bottom of the slab is bounded by a deterministic discontinuity (a smooth reflector). We consider waves incident from above the slab, and place our receivers within the slab to study the corresponding cross correlations. Otherwise, in the entire configuration the medium has a deterministic, smoothly varying component; to simplify the presentation, here, we assume this component to be constant and the slab to be flat. The incident wave is decomposed into wave packets. Each wave packet contains a particular scale. The decomposition is used to select a scale in relation to the fluctuations component of the medium in the slab. Through localization in phase space, the propagation and scattering of an incident wave packet can be described by a coupled system of paraxial wave equations written in curvilinear coordinates (with an associated Riemannian metric) which are defined by the rays, initiated by points in the support of the wave packet, in the deterministic component of the medium. Thus, in principle, each incident wave packet generates its own system of paraxial wave equations. The accuracy of this description can be proven to improve with increasingly finer scales, which is the regime considered here. Indeed, we view the EGF in the context of @p
1	The aim of this paper is to present how to implement a control volume approach improved by Hermite radial basis functions (CV-RBF) for geochemical problems. A multi-step strategy based on Richardson extrapolation is proposed as an alternative to the conventional dual step sequential non-iterative approach (SNIA) for coupling the transport equations with the chemical model. Additionally, this paper illustrates how to use PHREEQC to add geochemical reaction capabilities to CV-RBF transport methods. Several problems with different degrees of complexity were solved including cases of cation exchange, dissolution, dissociation, equilibrium and kinetics at different rates for mineral species. The results show that the solution and strategies presented here are effective and in good agreement with other methods presented in the literature for the same cases. HighlightsA control volume Hermite RBF scheme has been implemented for groundwater reactive problems.The standard SNIA approach was improved by a Richardson extrapolation.The PHREEQ modules are coupled with a transport solution by a local RBF method.The solution by CV-RBF is effective and in agreement with other numerical methods.
1	Abstract   Hierarchical data frameworks have been proposed to determine the relative value of fish habitats. Although conceptually accurate, judgments as to which habitat is more “essential” are limited by a lack of available information. This work provides much needed growth and production rates for gray snapper (Lutjanus griseus), an ontogenetic habitat shifting reef fish, during mangrove residency. Ages were estimated using modal progression analysis of length–frequency distributions coupled with a biologically-realistic spawning date. Growth estimates place age-1 L. griseus at 155 mm (TL), age-2 at 243, and age-3 at 302 mm. These size-at-age estimates are consistent with otolith-based studies and are a natural extension of linear growth models for early juveniles. Lutjanus griseus primarily use southeastern Florida mangrove shoreline habitats for approximately 2 years between 0.86 and 2.84 years of age. Corresponding production:biomass ratios for these cohorts were 1.51 and 0.90. While these values are similar to other estimates for fishes inhabiting vegetated coastal wetlands in North America, they are much less than new estimates from a Bahamian mangrove creek system. These new data highlight important differences between the habitat value of mangrove shorelines of continental (low-relief) and island (high-relief) systems.
1	Abstract   Non-vegetated creek edges were investigated to explore spatial nekton use patterns in a low salinity intertidal salt marsh creek network of the Yangtze River estuary along a stream-order gradient with four creek orders. Non-vegetated creek edges were arbitrarily defined as the approximately 3 m extending from the creek bank (the marsh–creek interface) into open water. Nekton was sampled using seine nets during daytime high slack water during spring tides for two or three days each in May through July 2008. Twenty-three nekton species (16 fishes and 7 crustaceans) were caught during the study. Fishes were dominated by gobies (Mugilogobius abei, Periophthalmus magnuspinnatus, Periophthalmus modestus, Synechogobius ommaturus), mullets (Chelon haematocheilus, Liza affinis) and Chinese sea bass (Lateolabrax maculatus). Crustaceans were dominated by mud crab (Helice tientsinensis) and white prawn (Exopalaemon carinicauda). Rank abundance curves revealed higher evenness of nekton assemblages in lower-order creeks compared to higher-order creeks. Fish abundance tended to increase with increasing creek order. Crustacean abundance was higher in the first–third order creeks than in the fourth-order creek. Dominant nekton species displayed various trends in abundance and length–frequency distributions along the stream-order gradient. The spatial separation of nekton assemblages between the first–third order creeks and the fourth-order creek could be attributed to geomorphological factors (distance to mouth and cross-sectional area). These findings indicate that both lower- and higher-order creek edges play important yet different roles for nekton species and life history stages in salt marshes.
0	Abstract   It was hypothesized that sediment composition, i.e. organic matters and minerals, and physical forcing can influence retention and release of silicate (SiO 4 ) and orthophosphate (o-PO 4 ) along salinity gradients. An experiment was performed to measure nutrient release by using treatments with and without sediment organic matter from the Guadalupe and Nueces Estuaries at five different salinities. The sample mixtures were shaken at intervals over the course of 48 h to simulate wind and river forcing. The release of silicate from sediments increased with time from 2 min to 48 h in all five salinities. The added orthophosphate concentration was adsorbed in most of the sediment containing organic matter and calcium-rich shells from both estuaries. From the sediments without organic matter, the release of orthophosphate was as high as 52 μmol/L. The sediment minerals quartz and calcite were abundant in both estuaries. The average quartz to corundum peak intensities ratio were 14.04 and 13.36 and the average calcite to corundum peak intensities ratio were 3.06 and 1.32 in the Guadalupe and Nueces Estuaries respectively. The average organic matter in the Guadalupe and Nueces estuaries were 10.67% and 13.39% respectively. The retention and release of orthophosphate from the sediments may have been caused by the bonding with organic matter and calcite in the sediments. These findings indicate that sediment composition was a significant contributor in the low dissolved orthophosphate concentration in the estuaries. The release of silicate from the sediments containing quartz, and organic matter, when shaken, indicate that the combined forcing of river and wind may have been maintaining the estuaries silicate concentrations.
1	Arthrophycus brongniartii (Harlan, 1832) is common in marginal-marine deposits in the Silurian Red Mountain Formation of Alabama. The ichnospecies, the second to be named in North America, is revived and emended after long disuse. Transitional forms to Rusophycus isp. and other morphologic evidence indicate that the maker of Arthrophycus was an arthropod, perhaps a trinucleine (raphiophorid?) trilobite. Interconnection of Arthrophycus and Nereites biserialis, as well as intergradation of Arthrophycus with Cruziana aff. quadrata, Phycodes flabellum, and Asterosoma ludwigae, indicate that these Red Mountain trace fossils were made by the same species of arthropod. Possible relationships with Arthrophycus alleghaniensis (Harlan, 1831) in the Silurian belt from Ontario to Tennessee are also explored. Ichnofamily Arthrophycidae Schimper, 1879 is emended. The ichnofamily is interpreted as chiefly the work of arthropods. Arthrophycus and other trace fossils from the Silurian of Alabama constitute a test case to build criteria for recognizing the members of complexes of trace fossils. In general, criteria such as interconnection of different forms, intergradation among unconnected forms, similarity of size, similarity of morphologic elements, and co-occurrence should be examined in order to determine the biologic and ethologic interrelationships of trace fossils. 7 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

1	Abstract   Lake Pannon was a large lake at the southern margin of the European plate, which separated from the Central Paratethys at the Sarmatian–Pannonian boundary and was filled completely with sediment during the Pliocene. The separation produced an endemic fauna that makes classical geological correlation problematic with sediments outside the lake. Magnetostratigraphic correlation could potentially solve the problem, and several long cores from deep-drillings have been analysed for polarity information. In the course of these studies, primary magnetite was assumed to carry the natural remanent magnetization (NRM). Later, when outcrops of dark-grey clays and marls of Lake Pannon were sampled for palaeomagnetic investigations of tectonic processes, greigite was discovered as the carrier of the NRM at several localities. This motivated a systematic study of the fine-grained sediments of Lake Pannon in order to identify the principal carriers of the NRM, to relate them to depositional environments, and to assess the importance of neoformation of magnetic minerals.  The concentration of magnetic minerals is low in the fine-grained sediments of Lake Pannon. This made extraction of the magnetic minerals impossible, so they were identified with magnetic methods. Magnetic experiments suggest that greigite is the most common magnetic mineral in the Lake Pannon sediments. Magnetite, when it occurs, is often accompanied by pyrite. Haematite is rare.  The studied sediments represent three time intervals: 11–9.3 Ma, 8–7 Ma and 6–4 Ma. In the 11–9.3 Ma sediments, greigite occurs as an original (early diagenetic) magnetic mineral. During this period, the climate was warm and humid; the lake was fairly deep and stratified; high organic productivity resulted in oxygen-depleted bottom waters. Burial was rapid, due to intensive erosion from the surrounding Carpathian and Alpine mountains. Magnetite-bearing sediments deposited during this period do not carry a coherent palaeomagnetic signal, which suggests that the magnetite was neoformed. The 8–7 Ma sediments were deposited in sublittoral, upper delta plain and swamp environments, in humid conditions. They are also greigite-bearing. During the third investigated time period (6–4 Ma), the climate was arid, the lake was of low salinity, and was restricted to the southern part of the Pannonian basin. These sediments were deposited in a distal environment (low sedimentation rate). The characteristic magnetic mineral of this period is magnetite, which most probably has a detrital origin.  Widespread greigite, which is always of diagenetic origin, suspected neoformation of magnetite in the older parts of Lake Pannon, and occasionally opposite polarities connected to greigite and magnetite when they occur together in the present study are important for magnetostratigraphic interpretation. They imply that detailed magnetic mineralogical investigations and documentation of the consistency of the NRMs (by working on fully oriented samples) are essential in magnetostratigraphic studies of molasse sediments.
1	Abstract   Contemporary climate change has resulted in great uncertainty in how glaciers and ice sheets around the Earth might evolve. It has long been appreciated that the contemporary West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) shares many similarities with the former Barents Sea Ice Sheet (BSIS). Therefore, an increasing number of studies have sought to investigate the Barents Sea glacial record to better understand marine-based glaciation. This paper reports the analysis of a new high-resolution bathymetric survey covering ~ 55,000 km2 in the central Barents Sea. The relative chronologies of newly-mapped glacial landforms such as mega-scale glacial lineations, grounding-zone wedges, moraines, and crevasse-squeeze ridges are used to reconstruct the ice sheet dynamics in the central Barents Sea. Our results show that the ice sheet responded dynamically with different periods of retreat, advance, and stagnation observed. These new landform records have been integrated with other geomorphological records in order to reconstruct the retreat pattern of the BSIS between 17–14 ka, when the Fennoscandian Ice Sheet is thought to have uncoupled from the BSIS. Our data shows that the dynamic drawdown of the ice sheet saddle by ice streams was probably the primary mechanism in separating the two ice sheets. After the ice sheets uncoupled, the BSIS is shown to have retreated episodically with several periods of relative stability. Geomorphological records such as those from the BSIS can be used to constrain ice sheet modelling and will help to develop a clearer understanding of marine-based glaciation and the role of ice streams in driving ice sheet evolution.
1	Abstract   To implement models of global change, information from peripheral regions and concerning the distinction between global and local events is needed. In this context, we studied the occurrence of hydrological changes over the last 5300 years in the southern most European area of active blanket bogs. The reconstruction of the bog surface wetness was performed on the basis of the analysis of plant macrofossils and peat humification. To interpret these proxies, the current botanical composition of the bog and the ecological behavior of the different plant species were used.  From its present ecological behavior, we have established the main indicator species for different bog surface wetness. The seeds of Juncus bulbosus and Drosera rotundifolia, which were significantly correlated with the humification index, as well as the seeds and rhizomes of Eriophorum angustifolium, were the primary indicators for wetness. The Sphagnum species are not abundant, and most are restricted to wet and damp periods.  The concordance between both proxies, in spite of certain discrepancies, allowed us to estimate the chronological sequence of hydrological changes along the bog profile. We have differentiated 10 wet periods during which the bog surface could be flooded or wet (5300–4850; 4350–3900; 3550–3350; 3150–3050; 2700–2450; 2250–2150; 1950–1300; 1150–1050; 900–800 and 700–20 cal. yr. BP). These identified wet periods are in agreement with previous paleoclimate studies with different spatial scales and proxies.
1	Abstract   Mean elevation of all continents, as well as mean elevation of individual continents, should be at the fundamental level controlled by the global tectonic and climatic systems. I propose a first-order model considering the interplay of the two factors in controlling mean elevation of continents. The model is able to account for the positive correlation between the present-day mean elevation and area of individual continents (except for Antarctica). Furthermore, it can also explain the low sea level during the times of supercontinents. Finally the model is used to evaluate the variation of continental crust thickness with time.
1	Abstract   Seismic shear waves that are polarized horizontally (SH) generally travel faster in the upper mantle than those that are polarized vertically (SV), and deformation of rocks under dislocation creep has been invoked to explain such radial anisotropy. Convective flow of the upper mantle may thus be constrained by modeling the textures that progressively form by lattice-preferred orientation (LPO) of intrinsically anisotropic grains. While azimuthal anisotropy has been studied in detail, the radial kind has previously only been considered in semi-quantitative models. Here, we show that radial anisotropy averages as well as radial and azimuthal anomaly-patterns can be explained to a large extent by mantle flow, if lateral viscosity variations are taken into account. We construct a geodynamic reference model which includes LPO formation based on mineral physics and flow computed using laboratory-derived olivine rheology. Previously identified anomalous  v  SV  regions beneath the East Pacific Rise and relatively fast  v  SH  regions within the Pacific basin at ~ 150 km depth can be linked to mantle upwellings and shearing in the asthenosphere, respectively. Continental anisotropy at shallow (~ 50 km) depth is under-predicted, and these deviations are in quantitative agreement with the expected signature of frozen-in, stochastically-oriented anisotropy from past tectonic episodes. We also consider two end-member models of LPO formation for “wet” and “dry” conditions for the asthenosphere (~ 150 km). Allowing for lateral variations in volatile content, the residual signal can be much reduced, and the inferred volatile patterns underneath the Pacific appear related to plume activity. In deeper layers (~ 250 km), anisotropy indicates that small-scale convection disrupts plate-scale shear underneath old oceanic lithosphere. We suggest that studying deviations from comprehensive geodynamic reference models, or “residual anisotropy”, can provide new insights into the nature and dynamics of the asthenosphere.
1	The decline of the Classic Maya civilization was complex and geographically variable, and occurred over a ~150-year interval, known as the Terminal Classic Period (TCP, C.E. 800–950). Paleoclimate studies based on lake sediments from the Yucatan Peninsula lowlands suggested that drought prevailed during the TCP and was likely an important factor in the disintegration of the Classic Maya civilization. The lacustrine evidence for decades of severe drought in the Yucatan Peninsula, however, does not readily explain the long 150-year socio-political decline of the Classic Maya civilization. Here we present a new, absolute-dated, highresolution stalagmite ?18O record from the northwest Yucatan Peninsula that provides a much more detailed picture of climate variability during the last 1500 years. Direct calibration between stalagmite ?18O and rainfall amount offers the first quantitative estimation of rainfall variability during the Terminal Classic Period. Our results show that eight severe droughts, lasting from 3 to 18 years, occurred during major depopulation events of Classic Maya city-states. During these droughts, rainfall was reduced by 52% to 36%. The number and short duration of the dry intervals help explain why the TCP collapse of the Mayan civilization occurred over 150 years.
0	Abstract   Water and soil erosion are serious issues in the Loess Plateau in China. The carbon and nitrogen cycles along river catchments during the soil erosion process have historically been poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the concentrations and isotopic signatures of carbon and nitrogen in river water, river-suspended materials and soil. Our results revealed that, in river catchments, from the water sources to their confluence with larger rivers, (1) the isotopic signatures of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) varied from − 9.2 to − 6.7‰ in May and from − 12.9 to − 9.3‰ in August. In addition, δ 13 C DIC  values were more negative in August than in May. These differences may be related to changes in the source and soil erosion. (2) The NO 3  −  nitrogen isotopic signature of the water ranged from 5.1 to 10.3‰ in May and from 3.5 to 6.4‰ in August. The δ 15 N org  of the suspended material also became more positive; similar trends can help us to understand the N cycle during soil erosion. Our investigation suggests that soil CO 2 /carbonates and soil NO 3  −  are dissolved into the Loess Plateau rivers during rainfall and soil erosion. The concentration and the isotopic signatures of carbon and nitrogen in rivers can be used for the quantitative evaluation of carbon and nitrogen transfer from the soil to the Loess Plateau rivers.
0	Abstract   Redox reactions with Fe-containing minerals in clay-rich sediments largely affect the speciation, mobility, and (bio-) availability of redox-sensitive contaminants. Here, we use mediated electrochemical oxidation (MEO) and reduction (MER), to quantify the electron accepting and donating capacities (EAC and EDC) of Boom Clay, a potential host formation for radioactive waste disposal. The relevant redox-active minerals pyrite, siderite, smectite and illite were first studied separately. MEO and MER of smectites and illites resulted in sharp current peak responses, reflecting fast electron transfer kinetics. Conversely, broad current peaks were obtained from MEO of pyrite. The current response to MEO of siderite was very small. Under the applied electrochemical conditions in MEO, pyrite was not completely oxidized and only a marginal fraction of siderite was oxidized. All structural Fe (Fe struct ) in smectites SWa-1 and SWy-1 was redox-active in MER and MEO, whereas in Fithian Illite and IMt-1 only 12–22% of the total Fe struct  was available. An empirical equation was used to describe the current curves of the tested minerals. This equation allowed to delineate the relative contributions of these minerals to MEO of their mixtures. The EDC of Boom Clay determined by MEO was 0.2 ± 0.05 mmol e − /g and predominantly consisted of contributions of pyrite, Fe struct  in clays and natural organic matter (NOM). Applying the empirical equation allowed to separate the oxidative current response into the contribution of pyrite with slower oxidation kinetics and the combined contribution of faster reacting Fe struct  and natural organic matter (NOM). Due to the absence of NOM isolates from Boom Clay, the EDC of NOM was estimated based on MEO measurements of dissolved organic matter in Boom Clay pore water and the organic carbon content of Boom Clay. The EDC of Fe struct  in clays was then obtained by subtracting the contributions of NOM and pyrite from the measured EDC. About 14% of the measured EDC can be attributed to Fe struct  which implies that about 50% of the structural Fe II  in Boom Clay is redox-active. In contrast, EAC measurements indicate that Fe III  struct  in Boom Clay is electrochemically inactive.
0	Abstract   The Sierras Bayas Group of the Tandilia System constitutes the Neoproterozoic sedimentary cover of the Rio de La Plata Craton in Argentina that accumulated amid the breakup of the Rodinia supercontinent and subsequent assembly of Gondwanaland. Evidence for glaciation in the Villa Monica Formation (VMF) at the base of the succession comes in the form of iron-rich laminated sediments containing dropstones composed predominantly of basement crystalline rocks and quartzites that, are sequentially overlain by a phosphatic mudstone and a ~ 40 m thick stromatolitic dolomite. Subtidal facies preserve columnar forms similar to post-glacial tubestone stromatolites seen in the Neoproterozoic records. These morphologies suggest rapid growth associated with elevated seawater alkalinity and high rates of carbonate accumulation records. The VMF dolomites in our four studied sections near Olavarria-Sierras Bayas area reveal a pronounced negative-to-positive δ13C up section that is similarly to these cap carbonates and others worldwide. Our sedimentological and geochemical study of the VMF sections reveal consistent carbon and oxygen isotope trends that may be useful for detailed intra-basinal correlations. Samples of the VMF fabric-retentive dolomite preserve an unusually narrow range of non-radiogenic strontium isotopic compositions (0.7068 to 0.7070) that are consistent with Cryogenian limestone facies in the potential Namibian and Brazilian equivalents. Exceptional preservation of 87Sr/86Sr compositions suggest the possibility of primary dolomite precipitation in post-glacial seawater, and furthermore that REE patterns and distributions may yield similar insights to redox conditions in the depositional basin. In particular, the VMF dolomites reveal depleted LREE abundances, a negative Ce anomaly, positive La and Gd anomalies, and low Y/Ho values. As a whole, these observations suggest oxidizing post-glacial seawater conditions associated with significant freshwater inputs into the basin. Global warming and increases in primary productivity and organic carbon burial linked to the buildup of oxygen, the positive δ13C trend and the increase in stromatolite biodiversity in the VMF.
1	article i nfo Caribbean Hydrozoa Long-term Millepora In this study, the abundance of Millepora spp. on the shallow (b9-m depth) fringing reefs of St. John, US Virgin Islands, was measured from 1992 to 2008 using photoquadrats recorded annually. The objectives were to describe how a rare, yet ecologically important invertebrate has changed in abundance over 16 years, and evaluate the extent to which the changes were associated with seawater temperature and storm intensity. Millepora spp. covered ≤1.5% of the benthos throughout the study, but it increased in cover as much as 306% between some consecutive years, while decreasing 67% between other years. Overall, mean Millepora spp. cover declined 49% from 0.99±0.33% in 1992 to 0.51±0.15% in 2008, in part because colonies became 47% smaller through shrinkage and fission. The percentage cover, number of branches, and population den- sity (i.e., colonies m −2 )o fMillepora spp. decreased in years characterized by warm seawater and intense storm effects, but the size of Millepora spp. colonies increased in years characterized by large numbers of cold days. Changing abundances of scleractinian corals are well documented on coral reefs, but the present study is unusual in demonstrating strong temporal variation in abundance of a rare taxon, probably as a result of some of the same physical conditions affecting scleractinians. As scleractinian corals decline in abun- dance, the dynamics of rare taxa are likely to play increasingly important roles in the community structure and function of tropical reefs.
1	Characterizing spatial and temporal variability of soil properties at field and landscape scales is tremendously important for a variety of agronomic and environmental concerns including solute transport modeling of non-point source pollutants in the vadose zone, site-specific crop management, and soil quality assessment, to mention a few. Currently, there is a global need to develop tools that evaluate the overall quality of soil to determine the effectiveness and sustainability of farm-management practices. The knowledge now exists for characterizing the spatial variability of soil quality with non-invasive geophysical measurements of apparent soil electrical conductivity (ECa) using mobile GPS-based systems. The objective of this research was to evaluate ECa-directed soil sampling as a means for monitoring management-induced spatio–temporal changes in soil quality. Appraisal was made of a specific management practice, the reuse of irrigation drainage water applied to a saline–sodic soil in central California. A soil quality assessment study was conducted on a 32.4-ha saline–sodic field comprised of 8 rectangular paddocks in California’s San Joaquin Valley from August 1999 to April 2002. The study evaluated the spatio–temporal changes that had occurred as a result of irrigation with drainage water over that time period. Using geospatial electromagnetic induction (EMI) measurements of ECa and a spatial response surface sampling design, 40 sites were selected that reflected the spatial variability of the ECa measurements. Duplicate samples were taken at eight selected sites (one randomly selected site from each paddock) to study local-scale variability. At each site soil-core samples were taken at 0.3-m intervals to a depth of 1.2 m and analyzed for
0	article Available carbon (C), measured as hot water extractable carbon (HC), has been suggested as an indicator to assess management effects on soil C fractions, transformations among C fractions, and carbon sequestration potential. Their upscaling to coarser scales has been hampered due to the cost and labor to measure C fractions. With the advent of visible/near-infrared-diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (VNIR-DRS) to infer on soil C fractions, new opportunities exist to combine sensor-based and geostatistical methods to estimate them across landscapes. Our research objectives were to (i) assess the accuracy of VNIR-DRS for estimating available C (HC) in soil, and (ii) compare interpolated HC estimates derived from laboratory measurements and VNIR-DRS derived estimates. The study site was within the Rio Grande floodplain in Quemado, Texas with mixed acreage of Arundo donax L. and Cynodon dactylon (L.) pers. Soil samples were taken in 10-cm depth increments from 0- to 50-cm depth, at 125 locations across a 34.5 ha field. Total C (TC, dry combustion), inorganic C (IC, modified pressure calcimeter), and HC (extraction at 80 °C) were measured and organic C (OC) was calculated by difference (TCIC). Partial least squares regression (PLSR) and boosted regression tree (RT) were used to relate TC, HC, IC, and OC to VNIR-DRS spectra. Ordinary kriging was used to interpolate HC derived from analytical measurements and the values derived from the best spectral estimation model (PLSR). All four C pools were estimated well using VNIR-DRS and PLSR (R
1	Methane emissions from wetlands contribute to the currently rising levels of methane in the atmosphere. Nonetheless, the assessments of methane-producing Archaea (methanogens) and their environmental controls are still rare particularly in soils from estuarine tidal marshes. In estuarine tidal marshes, the salinity gradient is commonly observed, and its effects on the methanogenic community are hardly known. In this study, in the Min River estuary, southeast China, we analyzed two freshwater and two brackish (oligohaline) marshes in a subtropical estuary, where we assessed methanogenic community structure and abundance by molecular cloning, sequencing, and quantitative PCR methods, as well as by means of soil physicochemical characteristics and concentration of methane dissolved in pore water. The common and dominant genera of these methanogens include Methanoregula, Methanobacterium, Methanosarcina, and Methanolinea in the four marshes. Phylotypes of the methanogens using H2/CO2 (Methanomicrobiales) or acetate (Methanosarcinales) were identified in the mcrA gene clone libraries and by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analyses. The abundance levels of methanogens in the two freshwater marshes were significantly higher than those in the two brackish marshes. The value of the Shannon Index (H′) of diversity and Simpson index (D) of evenness of methanogen mcrA clone libraries decreased along the salinity gradient from freshwater to brackish water. Methanogen community structure varied with soil depth in the four wetlands. The concentrations of methane in pore water also decreased from the freshwater sites to the brackish sites; this pattern is consistent with a change in the abundance of methanogens. Our results showed that in a low-level salinity gradient of a subtropical estuary, salinity is still a major factor controlling the overall community structure and abundance of methanogens.
1	Abstract   A single nondimensional parameter, the Rayleigh number, suffices to characterize the onset of convection in a fluid layer of constant thickness. Geodynamo simulations concern much more complicated situations in which the fluid motions occur in a rapidly rotating sphere or spherical shell. The governing equations can be scaled in more than one way, and this leads to several alternative definitions of the Rayleigh number. Immediate comparisons between results that use different scalings and different definitions of the Rayleigh number become impossible, and confusions can arise. In this paper, ways of avoiding ambiguity are described, and a preferred definition of the Rayleigh number is proposed that is particularly well-suited for geodynamo simulations.
1	Abstract   U–Pb and Hf isotope analysis of zircons from granitoids of the Permian–Triassic New England Batholith (eastern Australia) was carried out to provide constraints on the evolution of an isotopically and compositionally diverse batholith. Incipient plutonism in the early Permian resulted in the formation of isotopically evolved, peraluminous granodiorites of the Hillgrove Suite. Following this, mixing between crustal-derived (+ 5–+ 8 eHf units) and depleted mantle-derived magmas (+ 13–+ 18 eHf units), was responsible for the formation of the c. 282 Ma Bundarra Suite. The strongly metaluminous and isotopically depleted granites of the c. 268 Ma Clarence River Suite (+ 11–+ 16 eHf units) signify an increased role of isotopically depleted magmas during the formation of plutonic rocks in the middle Permian. Interestingly, this isotopic and chemical transience coincides with orogenic extension that was associated with the relocation for the southern New England Orogen (NEO) from a continental margin accretionary setting to that of a back-arc basin. Following attenuation, the NEO was thickened by contraction during the Hunter Bowen Event (265–255 Ma).  Forming after the Hunter Bowen Event, the metaluminous rocks of the c. 256 Ma Moonbi Suite were the product of mixing between magmas derived from evolved metaigneous rocks and enriched mantle (+ 3–+ 8 eHf units). We attribute the switch in isotopic character from highly depleted (i.e., Clarence River Suite) to evolved (i.e., Moonbi Suite) to crustal thickness before (i.e., thin) and after (i.e., thick) the Hunter Bowen Event. Evidence of renewed mixing between depleted and evolved magmas characterises the formation of the c. 249 Ma Uralla Suite (+ 7–+ 16 eHf units), which interestingly, was coeval with renewed orogenic extension in the early Triassic. Finally, the melting of deep crustal basalts below the southern New England Orogen in the middle Triassic (c. 233 Ma) resulted in the formation of moderately depleted leucomonzogranites and A-type magmas (+ 9–+ 12 eHf units).  Through combining new U–Pb and Hf zircon isotope data with pre-existing whole rock Nd and geochemical data, a link between geodynamic setting and granite petrogenesis has been identified, where: (i) in thick orogens, granites formed via partial melting of the crust and lack a significant depleted component; (ii) in thin orogens, granites form by mixing of crustal-derived and depleted mantle-derived magmas; and (iii) in highly attenuated orogens, granites can be extremely depleted and dominantly derived from the melting of upper mantle sources. This relationship may be associated with the development or reactivation of lithosphere scale detachments during orogenic extension that could facilitate the transportation of depleted magmas into the crust.
