0	We present a detailed study of two ca. 200 m-thick apatite-bearing ferrogabbro horizons of the Sept Iles layered intrusion (Canada). These rocks are the most evolved cumulates of the megacyclic units (MCU) I and II, and mark the transition between basaltic and silicic magmatism. They are made up of plagioclase (An55–34), olivine (Fo66–21), clinopyroxene (Mg#75–55), ilmenite, magnetite, apatite, ± pigeonite and are a significant source of Fe–Ti–P ore. Ferrogabbros have relatively uniform bulk-rock compositions in MCU I but are bimodal in MCU II. The liquid lines of descent for major elements in equilibrium with cumulates of MCU I and II have been calculated using a forward model formalism. Both trends evolve towards SiO2-enrichment and FeOt-depletion after saturation in Fe–Ti oxides. However, because of magma mixing in MCU II, they do not follow the same path. Evolved liquids from MCU II are shown to enter the experimentally-determined two liquid stability field, while MCU I liquids do not. Immiscibility in MCU II and its absence in MCU I are supported by the presence of contrasted reactive symplectites in cumulate rocks. Apatite-bearing ferrogabbros in MCU II have crystallized from distinct immiscible Fe-rich and Si-rich silicate melts which have physically segregated in the slow-cooling magma chamber. Two different types of cumulate rocks are thus produced: leucocratic and melanocratic gabbros. This is consistent with the presence of Si-rich and Fe-rich melt inclusions in apatite. In contrast, homogeneous ferrogabbros from MCU I were produced by simple fractional crystallization of a homogeneous liquid. Our data suggest that immiscibility could also explain the large geochemical variability of ferrogabbros in the Upper Zone of the Bushveld Complex (South Africa).
1	Abstract   Subhydrostatic fluid pressures in the Alberta Basin produce groundwater flow directions that directly oppose regional topography-driven flow, but the processes that contributed to the formation of large underpressures remain equivocal. Previous studies have largely neglected the influence of glacial unloading and focused primarily on erosion; however, the amount of underpressuring simulated by basin models that incorporate long-term erosion is insufficient. Moreover, conflicting rates and timing of erosion have been postulated for the study area. To address these problems, numerical simulations of regional groundwater flow were conducted along a 700-km-wide transect to test competing hypotheses of subnormal fluid pressure generation in the Alberta Basin.  Results based on modeling erosion since the Early Eocene and unloading of the Late Wisconsin ice sheet correlate betterwith fluid pressure data from Cretaceous strata than results based on rapid erosion since the Late Pliocene. The effects of glacial unloading should be considered in paleohydrologic studies where recent glaciations have occurred. Subnormal fluid pressures have significance for the timing of major groundwater flow reversals and possible implications for hydrocarbon migration and entrapment.
1	Abstract   Purpose  The total concentration of trace elements in soils does not always represent the fraction available for organisms and/or plants because they accumulate in several geochemical forms. The bioavailable concentration of Zn and Pb in mine tailing soils and its relation to the concentration in the leaves of plants growing there are analysed.    Materials and methods  The three-step sequential extraction BCR method was used to analyse samples from mine tailing and uncontaminated soils. The correlations of the Zn and Pb contents in the three BCR steps with the total concentrations of both trace elements in soils and plants and with the soil characteristics were determined. Three plant species were analysed: Dittrichia viscosa, Euphorbia pithyusa subsp. cupanii, Cistus salviifolius. The study area was situated in the Sulcis-Iglesiente biogeographic sector (SW Sardinia, Italy).    Results and discussion  The soils with the highest total concentration of trace elements also presented the greatest metal availability. In general, the ratios of Pb and Zn concentrations in the BCR steps and the respective total concentrations in the soils were similar. The mine tailing soils registered high values for total Zn and Pb and also showed the highest percentages of these trace elements in the first two BCR fractions. However, the uncontaminated soils gave the highest percentages in the residual fraction. The total Pb concentration in the soils correlated with the concentrations found in the first two BCR steps (BCR1 and BCR2) and in the residue. For Zn, positive correlations were found with the three BCR steps. The correlations between the element extractions in the BCR steps and the soils characteristics depended on the particular soil type. Plant characteristics determined the correlations between the Pb and Zn concentration in leaves and soils. Specifically, none of the plants studied showed significant correlations between the Pb concentration and that found in the BCR steps. The opposite occurred for Zn whose concentration in plants appeared to be positively correlated with the concentrations found in the three BCR steps.    Conclusions  The Pb concentrations in plants and in the BCR steps were not indicative of the bioavailability of this element in the soil. On the contrary, the Zn concentration in the leaves showed the bioavailability of this element in the soil and the constituents to which it was related. The BCR method proved to be appropriate in case of Zn showing the existing correlations with the soil constituents and the plant contents.
0	Abstract   This study investigated the effects that ghost shrimp have on the distribution of metals in sediment. We measured levels of HNO 3 -extractable zinc and cadmium in surface sediment, in ghost shrimp burrow walls and in sediment ejected by the ghost shrimp from their burrows, at five sandy intertidal sites in Tampa Bay. Ghost shrimp densities and their rate of sediment ejection were also quantified, as were sediment organic content and silt + clay content. Densities of ghost shrimp ( Sergio trilobata  and  Lepidophthalmus louisianensis ) averaged 33/m 2  at our sites, and they ejected sediment at an average rate of 28 g/burrow/day. Levels of both Zn and Cd were significantly higher in burrow walls than in surface sediments. Sediment ejected by the shrimp from their burrows had elevated levels of Zn (relative to surface sediments) at one of the sites. Sediment organic content and silt + clay content were higher in burrow-wall sediments than in ejected sediment, which in turn tended to have values above those of surface sediments. Differences in levels of HNO 3 -extractable Zn and Cd among sediment types may be a consequence of these sediments differing in other physiochemical characteristics, though the differences in metal levels remained statistically significant for some sites after correcting for differences in organic content and silt + clay content. We conclude that the presence of ghost shrimp burrows contributes to spatial heterogeneity of sedimentary metal levels, while the ghost shrimp bioturbation results in a significant flux of metals to the sediment surface and is expected to decrease heterogeneity of metal levels in sedimentary depth profiles.
1	Abstract   The Mogi Guacu River rises in Bom Repouso (Minas Gerais State — Brazil) in the Mantiqueira Ridge, and flows into the Rio Pardo river at an elevation of 483 m in Pontal (Sao Paulo State — Brazil), after running a 530 km long course. Especially along the Lower Mogi Guacu Basin, the river morphology is extremely sinuous, characterized by intense processes of channel migration, avulsion, abandonment and reactivation of the channel, producing an extensive alluvial plain composed of a series of associated relief forms and sedimentary facies. Among these forms, point bar deposits by lateral accretion, abandoned meanders, paleo-channels and fluvial terraces are notable features. In this sense, the objective of this work was to investigate whether these features could be linked to environmental changes. To reach this goal, soil properties of a catena of the Jatai Ecological Station (Luiz Antonio — Sao Paulo State) were analyzed in four sectors: Slope, Terrace I, Terrace II and Alluvial Plain. The results from grain-size determination, geochemical and isotopic studies, dating, paleopalynology, coal fragments and micromorphology are presented in this paper. From these analyses, a paleo-environmental evolution divided in three stages is proposed for the area: 130,000 YBP (Upper Pleistocene), when the Mogi Guacu River base level was approximately 6 m above the present one; a drier second phase 10,250 years BP (Lower Holocene), when an organic horizon was formed inside of an abandoned meander (oxbow lake), and a third phase, 2096 YBP (Upper Holocene), of reactivation of a warm and humid climate that promoted the development of a two meters thick Typic Udifluvent in a sector where the Mogi Guacu River no more floods due to the incision of its thalweg, reaching more than six-meters depth in the last 130,000 years BP. Thus, this paper used a fluvial geomorphologic approach and its interplay with climate to understand how the landscape was shaped from Upper Pleistocene to Holocene, however, Neotectonics might have played a relevant role as well, not only in the Mogi Guacu River Basin, but also in the Parana Sedimentary Basin.
0	Abstract   Locating the magma source for the mafic dyke swarms in the North China Craton (NCC) is important for evaluating tectonic setting and emplacement mechanism. Here we have conducted systematic AMS studies on Paleoproterozoic dykes from the Fengzhen, Fuping and Lvliang areas of the NCC. Rock magnetic analyses indicate that PSD magnetite is the predominant magnetic carrier although the Lvliang dykes contain more SD magnetic grains than the Fengzhen and Fuping dykes. The Fengzhen and Fuping dykes have mostly normal AMS fabrics whilst the Lvliang dykes exhibit a larger proportion of intermediate AMS fabrics. Most of the Fuping dykes are found to have intruded sub-vertically upward although some fabrics indicate northward magma flow from imbrication and the distribution of K1 AMS axes. The Lvliang dykes identify a southwestward magma flow from opposed imbrications and distributions of K1 AMS axes. The Fuping area is thus interpreted to have been located near to the magma source which fed most dykes in the central NCC. A variety of magma sources are suggested for dykes in other parts of the NCC. Dykes near the southern margin of the craton probably resulted from lateral migration of magma from the Xiong’er source and contrast with the dykes in the central NCC fed by the Fuping magma source. Further Paleoproterozoic magma sources likely remain to be identified.
1	Abstract   Broadcasting Satellite Systems (BSS) have experienced a constant growth in the last years. Nowadays the traditional concept of broadcasting networks as distributors of passive content to the end user is deeply changing toward the more challenging large-scale provision of interactive multimedia services. The paper will present the more likely trends in emerging Satellite Broadcasting Missions addressing the impact of new requirements on system architectures.
1	Abstract   Zones like those of Oppel and Hedberg's Oppel-Zone are commonly interpreted as rock units delimited temporally. A more restricted view is that they are rock units empirically defined by bioevents that occur in the same order in all sections. Methods used by Oppel and definitions proposed by Hedberg are reviewed to assess their adequacy for definition of biostratigraphic units and their ability to support temporal inferences. Although they are usually interpreted as chronostratigraphic units, Oppel defined his zones in stratigraphic space, without temporal reference. In contrast, Hedberg required that bioevents for his Oppel-Zone should be approximately isochronous across their distribution but provided no operational way to identify such bioevents. Neither author clearly indicated how boundaries should be defined. Recourse to a principle of biosynchroneity to support inferences that stratigraphically ordered bioevents are temporal markers conflicts with knowledge of the biogeographies of modern taxa. Evolutionary theory explains why some bioevents occur in the same stratigraphic order but does not support the inference that they are isochronous events. Since its inception biostratigraphy has focused on ordered classifications, like those of Oppel. Stratigraphic codes should allow for a complementary category of biofacies zones that reflect depositional environments and are not constrained to occur in a particular order.
1	We previously examined the 3-year response of breeding bird communities to timber harvest in riparian areas using two harvest techniques (full tree harvest (GPL) and cut-to-length (CTL)) along first- to third-order streams in northern Minnesota, USA. We revisited the same 12 sites 9 years post-harvest and compared community composition, total abundance, species richness, and the abundance of bird guilds on harvest plots randomly assigned to four treatments (three plots per treatment). Analyses revealed a significant response of the bird community to timber harvest in the riparian area. Nine years post-harvest, bird communities in the uncut riparian buffers were statistically indistinguishable from control bird communities. Differences in bird communities between CTL and GPL treatments detected 3 years post-harvest in buffers were no longer evident after 9 years. Breeding bird community composition in harvested buffers became more similar to uncut and control buffer communities in species composition. All treatment buffers continued to have more species and individuals than control buffers; these bird species had affinities for early-successional forests. No differences among forest interior species or ground-nesting birds were evident between treatments 9 years post-harvest.
1	Abstract   The role of common roadside fern (Dicranopteris curranii) on the recovery of logging roads in headwater catchments of Peninsular Malaysia was examined. Hortonian overland flow from a 51.5 m road section was monitored during the 1-year study period along with sporadic measurements of sediment export before and during fern growth. Furthermore, the event-based influence of fern cover on rainfall input and flux of DOC, K, Mg, and Ca were estimated using bulk rainfall collectors (176 cm2) and compared with those in the adjacent forest canopy for six storms. Air temperatures measured beneath fern cover and forest canopy were compared with those on the open road. Road-generated runoff was reduced by 4.8 mm after fern growth during storms with
1	Abstract   The impact of anthropogenic linear gaps (such as roads, paths, and drainage ditches) on the diversity and other features of the flora of managed forests is still poorly studied. The main aim of our study was to analyse the plant trait responses to the presence of drainage ditches and forest roads. These two kinds of anthropogenic gaps differ in their structure (microtopography) and function. The functional traits of species in plots containing different anthropogenic linear gaps were compared with those in plots without such gaps inside surrounding forests. The floristical composition of 838 plots was analysed by RLQ ordination followed by fourth-corner analysis. Both drainage ditches and forest roads were characterised by a significantly higher number of species than the surrounding forests. However, they differed with regard to their functional traits. The presence of a road was positively associated with occurrence of plants whose propagules are dispersed by wind, water or by transportation on the outside of vertebrate animals, as well as with occurrence of species that have upward dynamic tendencies in a number of localities in the country scale. The floristic composition of plots lying inside the forests was also associated with the same traits but the relationship was reversed. By contrast, ditches did not show any associations with species traits. The influence of linear gaps on the pattern of species functional traits depends on the degree of habitat diversification associated with a given structure and whether its functioning involves the movement of people and vehicles.
1	The inception of the sheet flow regime as well as the effects of the phase lag when the sheet flow regime is established were investigated for oscillatory flows and combined steady and oscillatory flows. A new criterion for the inception of sheet flow is proposed based on around 300 oscillatory flow cases from experiments. This criterion was introduced in the Camenen and Larson [Camenen, B., Larson, M., 2005. A bedload sediment transport formula for the nearshore. Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science 63, 249-260.] bed load formula in order to take into account phase-lag effects in the sheet flow regime. The modification of the Camenen and Larson formula significantly improves the overall agreement with data and yields a correct behavior in relation to some of the main governing parameters, which are the median grain size d(50), the orbital wave velocity U-w, and the wave period T-w. The calibration of the new formula was based on more than 200 experimental data values on the net sediment transport rate for a full wave cycle. A conceptual model was also proposed to estimate the ratio between sediment transport rate with and without phase lag, (r(pl)=q(s,net)/q(s,net,phi=0)). This simple model provides accurate results and may be used together with any quasi-steady model for bed load transport. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All tights reserved.
1	X-ray computed tomography (CT) provides an insight into the progression of dissolution in the tests of planktonic foraminifera. Four species of foraminifera (G. ruber [white], G. sacculifer, N. dutertrei and P. obliquiloculata) from Pacific, Atlantic and Indian Ocean core-top samples were examined by CT and SEM. Inner chamber walls began to dissolve at Δ[CO32−] values of 12–14 μmol/kg. Close to the calcite saturation horizon, dissolution and precipitation of calcite may occur simultaneously. Inner calcite of G. sacculifer, N. dutertrei and P. obliquiloculata from such sites appeared altered or replaced, whereas outer crust calcite was dense with no pores. Unlike the other species, there was no distinction between inner and outer calcite in CT scans of G. ruber. Empty calcite crusts of N. dutertrei and P. obliquiloculata were most resistant to dissolution and were present in samples where Δ[CO32−] ≈ − 20 μmol/kg. Five stages of preservation were identified in CT scans, and an empirical dissolution index, XDX, was established. XDX appears to be insensitive to initial test mass. Mass loss in response to dissolution was similar between species and sites at ~ 0.4 μg/μmol/kg. We provide calibrations to estimate Δ[CO32−] and initial test mass from XDX.
1	Abstract   In the Imja Kola valley (eastern Nepal), Miocene peraluminous leucogranite dykes were emplaced within transtensional shear zones synchronously with regional amphibolite–facies metamorphism in the metamorphic host rocks. Within the dykes the magmatic foliations, parallel to the metamorphic schistosity, are cross-cut by thin (millimetre to centimetre size) shear zones, which are made up of prismatic and/or fibrolitic sillimanite with a minor amount of white mica. These structures have a heterogeneous distribution and form networks of strongly deformed and foliated layers wrapping around poorly deformed granitic pods. The textural and strain features are consistent with development of sillimanite shear zones as a result of heterogeneous deformation and fluid action, which allowed the replacement of strained magmatic minerals such as feldspar and biotite by means of incongruent pressure solution. The described example illustrates that nucleation and development of heterogeneous shear zones under amphibolite facies conditions, is also strongly favoured by brittle fracturing and fluid action at the grain-scale along pre-existing planes of weakness. The growth of cracks and fractures can be regarded as a sequence of short lived brittle events, due to work hardening, which punctuate a history of plastic deformation.
1	Abstract   †Lepicerus mumia Jaloszynski &amp; Yamamoto, sp. nov. is described based on a Cenomanian Myanmar amber inclusion. This is the third known and the best preserved fossil of ‘lepiceroid’ myxophagan beetles, making it possible to carry out a more detailed comparative study than previously published findings. Detailed analyses of diagnostic characters given by previous authors for †Haplochelus (†Haplochelidae) and †Lepichelus (= Lepiceroides) (Lepiceridae) led to conclusions that some features might have been misinterpreted, others do not differ from those in Lepicerus, and the remaining morphological structures can be regarded as variable within one genus. Consequently, Haplochelus and Lepichelus are placed as junior synonyms of Lepicerus, and the synonymy between Haplochelidae and Lepiceridae, previously suggested by other authors, is maintained. Lepicerus mumia, although classified in the extant genus, shows an unusual, presumably ancestral myxophagan character state, a partly divided protarsus, with a distinctly demarcated, enlarged and curved tarsomere 1. The presence of a crust partly covering the body of L. mumia suggests a similar biology as that of two extant species that live near river banks among other semiaquatic arthropods.
1	Abstract   Dust storm is a primary natural hazard that impact human activities. Previous work has simulated dust events with Eta model. This paper reports our effort to migrate a Dust Regional Atmospheric Model (DREAM) to the Nonhydrostatic Mesoscale Model (NMM), core of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) system’s (WRF–NMM)-based dust model. The process is as follows: (1) the DREAM model is modified to fit into a high-performance computing environment by parallelizing the dust model based on the WRF–NMM weather forecasting model. We couple a dust module to the WRF–NMM model and parallelize the serial program using Message Passing Interface (MPI). (2) The performance of the parallel dust simulation model is tested using the southwestern United States as the experiment area and a dust event during 7 January 2008 for the case study. (3) The new dust model based on WRF–NMM is implemented and tested on a Linux cluster with 28 computing nodes and over 200 CPU cores. The new model can leverage high-performance computing clusters to reduce the execution time while at the same time enhancing the simulation resolution. As tested, when simulating a 72 h period, the WRF–NMM dust model took 1.8 h when using a resolution of 1/9 of a degree grid space, when 36 CPU cores were used for high-performance computing. The results show that the parallelized version of the dust simulation model can get a maximum speedup about 13.3. We also built a transformation component to export the model output to geographic information system (GIS) software through a Web Map Service (WMS).
1	Unaccounted fishing mortality has been the focus of a growing body of research. Its importance as both an input to stock assessment models and as information to be presented to fishery managers is now being realized. Such information is usually gathered by expensive at-sea sampling programmes and through complex experiments. Proposed here is a modeling approach that use estimates of selectivity to estimate discard and escapee mortality through a series of simple equations. The probabilities of first, being caught by a fishing gear, and second, retained to become part of the landings, are modeled as a function of fish length. A variety of methods have been proposed for the presentation of information about unaccounted fishing mortality and an example of both a graphical presentation of the fate of fish encountering fishing gear and a tabulated set of efficiency indices are described. As an example the proposed approach is applied to the Hauraki Gulf snapper (Pagrus auratus) fishery off the northeast coast of New Zealand. It is found that overall the fishery is quite efficient when compared to reported overseas fisheries and that unaccounted fishing mortality may not be a significant component of total fishing mortality.
1	A mathematical model of the vertical distribution of fish eggs and larvae in response to changes in their buoyancy was developed and applied to eggs and larvae of blue whiting (Micromesistius poutassou). The model balances buoyancy and vertical mixing and allows for changes in buoyancy during development, as well as for variations in the physical properties of the water column with depth. Input data for the buoyancy of eggs and larvae were derived from experiments using a densitygradient column; the neutral buoyancy of blue whiting eggs was observed to increase over the duration of embryonic development from a salinity of below 34 to near 40 while larvae immediately after hatching were neutrally buoyant in a salinity of around 36.6. Input data for the vertical distribution of blue whiting eggs at hatching were derived from the results of plankton sampling to the west of the British Isles. These showed early stage eggs to be distributed in most abundance in the depth range 460‐580 m, with relatively little observed change through the remainder of embryonic development, and for larvae to became progressively concentrated in the upper 50 m of the water column. For both eggs and larvae, the model results were in close agreement with field observations. The lack of any marked displacement of the egg distributions was shown to be a reflection of their change from being initially buoyant, to sinking in the water column during the later phases of development, this behaviour being an adaptation to their bathypelagic habit. The model results also indicated that the ascent of the larvae from the spawning depths to the near-surface layers could be due entirely to buoyancy-induced passive rising of the larvae. # 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

1	The oxygen-isotope records from Greenland ice cores show a very strong, reproducible pattern of alternation between warm Greenland Interstadials (GI) and cold Greenland Stadials (GS) at millennial-scale during the last glacial period. Here we summarise what is known about this variability from ice core records. The typical cycle has a sawtooth pattern, with a very rapid warming event (occurring in a few decades), a slow cooling trend, and then a final fast cooling. 25 such events have been numbered in the last glacial. The recent GICC05 age scale provides the best available age scale that can be directly applied to this stratigraphy, and we summarise the timing of the warming events, and the length and strength of each event. The Greenland stratigraphy can be transferred to other records if we make assumptions about the contemporaneous nature of rapid events in different archives. Other parameters, such as the snow accumulation rate, and the concentration of terrestrial dust and sea salt recorded in the Greenland cores, also show a strong contrasting pattern between GI and GS. Methane concentrations are generally high during GI and lower during GS, with the increase from GS to GI occurring within a century. Antarctic ice cores show a different pattern: each GI has an Antarctic counterpart, but Antarctica appears to warm while Greenland is in a GS, and cool during GI. These changes are consistent with a mechanism involving ocean heat transport, but the rapid nature of warmings poses a challenge for modellers, while the rapid methane changes pose questions about the pattern of land biosphere emissions during the glacial that are also relevant for understanding glacial-interglacial methane variability.
1	Abstract   In order to investigate competition for light between trees and crops in an agroforestry system, we wrote a simulation model of light interception and growth by a system of hedgerows and an interplanted crop. To calculate light interception, hedgerows are modeled as long prisms, solar angles and hedgerow shadow lengths are calculated, and light intercepted by the hedgerows and points in the alley is summed. Biomass allocation to leaves and wood and the new hedgerow dimensions are calculated from empirical allometric equations. Hedgerow shoots are modeled as a population undergoing density-dependant mortality. Parameters for the model were developed from an alley cropping experiment of hedgerows of  Flemingia macrophylla , a legume shrub with broad leaves, grown alone or intercropped with maize on the island of Kauai, Hawaii. The model was tested with data from field experiments conducted in 1995 and 1996. In 1995, light interception simulated by the model for a point on the floor of the alley tracked measured light interception well over the course of the crop both when hedgerow sizes were input from field measurements and when they were simulated. Hedgerow biomass predicted by the model closely followed that measured in periodic harvests. In 1996, light interception simulated by the model tracked measured light interception well when the model was run with measured hedge dimensions, but the model under predicted hedgerow growth and, thus, over predicted transmission when growth was simulated. Radiation use efficiencies ( e ) for the hedgerows over the entire cropping season were calculated by regressing harvest biomass against light interception as calculated by the model. These averaged 0.18 (S.E. 0.005) g above-ground biomass mol −1  photosynthetically active photons for both treatments in 1995 and 0.21 (S.E. 0.008) g mol −1  in 1996. While hedgerow biomass was affected by the presence of the crop, the fact that  e  was the same in both treatments indicated that competition was overwhelmingly for light rather than for water or nutrients.
1	Abstract   Paleogeographic maps were constructed to depict the Phanerozoic plate tectonic configuration, paleoenvironment and lithofacies. These maps illustrate the geodynamic evolution of the circum-Arctic region. The relationship of the continental configuration, lithofacies, tectonics and climate from the disassembly of Rodinia to the assembly and breakup of Pangea is clearly depicted on this series of reconstructions. The distribution of lithofacies shows climatic change associated with continental assembly and disassembly as well as with the steady northward drift of the continents.  From a regional perspective the facies in basins along the circum-Arctic margin reflect various stages of geotectonic development. The assembly of continents contributed to the formation of foreland basins. The breakup of continents, especially of the Pangean supercontinent, generated basins related to rifting and passive margin development. The subduction zones are related to the back-arc basins. The inversion caused by ridge pushing played an important role in the basin evolution.
1	Abstract   This study analyzes the structural development of the Gunsan Basin in the central Yellow Sea, based on multi-channel seismic reflection profiles and exploratory well data. The basin comprises three depressions (the western, central, and eastern subbasins) filled with a thick (ca. 6000 m) Cretaceous to Paleogene nonmarine succession. It was initiated in the early Cretaceous due to intracontinental extension caused by oblique subduction of the Izanagi plate under the Eurasian plate and sinistral movement of the Tan-Lu fault. The basin appears to have undergone transtension in the late Cretaceous–Eocene, caused by dextral movement of the Tan-Lu and its branching faults. The transtension was accommodated by oblique intra-basinal normal faults and strike-slip (or oblique-slip) movement of a NE-trending bounding fault in the northern margin of the central subbasin. The entire basin was deformed (NE–SW contraction) in the Oligocene when tectonic inversion occurred, possibly due to the changes in strike-slip motion, from right- to left-lateral, of the Tan-Lu fault. During the early Miocene, extension resumed by reactivation of the pre-existing normal and transpressional faults. A combination of extension, uplift, and erosion resulted in differential preservation of the early Miocene succession. At the end of the early Miocene, extension ceased with mild contraction and then the basin thermally subsided with ensued rise in sea level.
0	Abstract   Homo ergaster/Homo erectus in Africa and H. erectus in the Old World are securely associated with a toolkit of well-conceived bifacially worked implements of handaxes and cleavers of the Acheulean techno-complex. In India, the abundant handaxe–cleaver assemblages have always been attributed as the work of H. erectus on the basis of comparisons with Africa and the Old World. In 1982, the first cranium of an advanced H. erectus was discovered.  In Central Java, many fossil remains of H. erectus have come to light since Dubois found the first skull in 1891. However, it could never be securely established which tools belonged to H. erectus. The Sangiran and Ngandong industries of small flakes have provisionally been connected with late H. erectus soloensis. The Pacitan industry, Java, which has yielded a number of handaxe-like tools, and the so-called handaxes from Cabenge in Sulawesi, have now been established as being of uppermost Pleistocene age, being the work of modern humans.  In China and Korea, “handaxes” have been recorded at several truly Early Paleolithic sites, such as Chongokni, Lantian, Bose, and Dingcun. However, these findings are widely dispersed and only indicate that such pointed and sometimes bifacially worked tools are occasional elements within a cobble tool tradition. H. erectus of Zhoukoudian Locality I, on the other hand, is associated with a small flake industry. No Chinese Paleolithic site can be definitely connected with an Acheulean tradition.
1	Abstract   Spores, pollen and dinoflagellate cysts of Late Pleistocene and Holocene sediments were analyzed from Giant Gravity Core 18 from the Black Sea continental slope, recovered from a water depth of 971 m. The investigated length of the core is 203.5 cm. It includes 3 lithological units: light grey clay, sapropels and coccolith-bearing ooze. The core was sampled at 5–10 cm intervals. Sampling of the interval 141.5–126 cm was carried out at every cm. AMS radiocarbon dating of bulk organic carbon was performed on 18 selected sediment layers. This chronological data allowed the first high-resolution pollen stratigraphy of Late Quaternary sediments from the western Black Sea area to be presented. The percentage spore–pollen diagram is divided into 6 local pollen assemblage zones. The trends in the vegetation dynamics and climate changes and the early history of migration of the majority of the arboreal taxa that nowadays occur in the Eastern Balkan Range were traced out. The palynological record suggests that open oak forests were spread in the Eastern Balkan Range at the beginning of the Holocene and shows early migration of the major temperate arboreal species such as Quercus, Ulmus, Tilia and Carpinus betulus. This vegetation palaeosuccession continues with the spreading of mixed oak forests from 8950 until 2620 cal. BP (8650 ± 40 until 3120 ± 35 14C BP) followed by destructive changes due to human impact and climate deterioration. A cooling of Holocene climate that is well known in the North Atlantic region as the “8200 yrs cold event” is identified for the first time in marine records from the Bulgarian Black Sea area. The assemblages of dinoflagellate cysts and acritarchs were investigated to provide a reconstruction of surface seawater salinity and surface seawater temperature changes. Two main dinoflagellate cyst assemblages, one dominated by fresh- to brackish water species such as Spiniferites cruciformis and Pyxidinopsis psilata and a subsequent one, that is characterized by euryhaline marine Mediterranean species such as Lingulodinium machaerophorum, Spiniferites belerius, Spiniferites bentorii, Operculodinium centrocarpum and acritarchs Cymatiosphaera globulosa testified a change in SSS from low salinity (
1	Abstract:   Analysis of sediment records and AMS radiocarbon dates are used to reconstruct Quaternary landscapes and palaeoenvironments of the ancient Roman harbour at Narbonne. Capital of the Roman Province Gallia Narbonensis, which extended from the Pyrenees to the Alps, Narbonne was one of the largest port cities in the northwest Mediterranean during the first millennium AD. Yet, the strategies deployed in managing the harbour, particularly the management of natural processes, are little understood. A synthesis of archaeological, geomorphological and geophysical data was made to assess the palaeoenvironmental constraints faced by residents of Narbonne, and what strategies they may have adopted in the management thereof. Harbour structures dating from the 1st–5th centuries AD discovered in Castelou and Mandirac were intended to canalize an Aude river branch allowing transfer and unloading of trade goods. These new insights about the harbour of Narbonne provide a valuable comparison for other ancient Mediterranean harbours such as Ostia (Italy), Tell About Hawam (Israel), Taposiris (Egypt).
1	Abstract   Cover crops are increasingly used for weed management. But selecting the most suitable species of cover crop to be associated with a main crop requires long-term trials. We present a model-based method that uses a reduced number of parameters to help select cover crops in the context of banana cover-cropping systems. We developed the SIMBA-CC model to focus on radiation interception. The model was calibrated for 11 cover crop species by measuring their growth in 4 m2 plots with three levels of shade (0, 50, and 75%). The SIMBA-CC model served to predict the long term growth potential of the 11 cover crop species in function of the radiation under the banana crop canopy. The model was validated using three species in association with banana plants. We defined three indicators based on outputs of the model to assess the ability of each of the 11 species (i) to compete with weeds and (ii) to be maintained in the long-term under the canopy of the main crop, and (iii) to evaluate competition with the main crop for nitrogen resource. This ex ante evaluation revealed the most promising species to be intercropped with banana. Finally, the SIMBA-CC model was used to define the light interception traits of a virtual cover crop that satisfy the three indicators in the case of intercropping with banana. We showed that to satisfy the three criteria, cover crops with low values of optimal photosynthetically active radiation (PARopti) should have moderate maximal biomass productivity, while crops with higher PARopti values should have a higher maximal productivity. The use of functional traits and modeling appears effective to disentangle the relations between intrinsic traits of cover crops and effect traits that affect the performances of the intercropping system.
1	Abstract   Natural iron fertilization promotes the phytoplankton bloom that takes place on the Kerguelen Plateau in the Indian sector of the Southern Ocean. We measured 228Ra (T1/2=5.75 yr) and 226Ra (T1/2=1602 yr) in waters above the Kerguelen Plateau in order to provide information on the water-mass pathways, which in turn could help elucidate the mechanisms controlling iron fertilization in that area. 228Ra activities are extremely low in this region, being in most cases   Using the 228Ra profile obtained at station A3, we could estimate the vertical eddy diffusivity (Kz) on the Kerguelen Plateau. Our Kz estimate (1.5×10−4±1.3×10−4 m2/s) compares well with that reported by Park et al. [2008a. Internal tides and vertical mixing over the Kerguelen Plateau. Deep-Sea Research II, doi:10.1016/j.dsr2.2007.12.027] based on CTD/LADCP data. By combining this Kz estimate with the gradient of dissolved Fe observed at A3 [Blain, S., Sarthou, G., Laan, P., 2008. Distribution of dissolved iron during the natural iron fertilization experiment KEOPS (Kerguelen Plateau, Southern Ocean). Deep-Sea Research II, doi:10.1016/j.dsr2.2007.12.028], we calculate a vertical Fe flux of 1.0–14.3 nmol/m2 d.
1	Field study, thermochronology and geochemistry of the east Lungmu Co (LMC) range highlight some of the geological events that shaped western Tibet. The LMC fault zone has long been interpreted as the boundary between the Tianshuihai terrane of Laurasian affinity and the Qiangtang block of Gondwanian affinity. In the LMC range, the Paleozoic series is intruded by the Mangtsa leucogranite whose zircon have a U/Pb age of 116.9 ± 1 Ma and by mafic rocks with U/Pb zircon ages ranging from 116.9 ± 1 to 95.1 ± 1.7 Ma. Geochemistry of the mafic rocks indicates that they have been emplaced in a supra-subduction zone setting, probably the north dipping Nujiang suture zone. 40Ar/39Ar micas ages of the granite indicate that cooling below ~ 350 °C occurred between 105 and 85 Ma. 40Ar/39Ar K-feldspar data suggest a fast cooling event at 60-55 Ma, which we relate to the reactivation of the LMC suture zone as a thrust at the onset of the India-Eurasia collision. The last, and still active, deformation event corresponds to left-lateral strike-slip faulting along the ENE-WSW LMC fault.
1	Abstract   The island of Seram, eastern Indonesia, experienced a complex Neogene history of multiple metamorphic and deformational events driven by Australia–SE Asia collision. Geological mapping, and structural and petrographic analysis has identified two main phases in the island's tectonic, metamorphic, and magmatic evolution: (1) an initial episode of extreme extension that exhumed hot lherzolites from the subcontinental lithospheric mantle and drove ultrahigh-temperature metamorphism and melting of adjacent continental crust; and (2) subsequent episodes of extensional detachment faulting and strike-slip faulting that further exhumed granulites and mantle rocks across Seram and Ambon. Here we present the results of sixteen 40Ar/39Ar furnace step heating experiments on white mica, biotite, and phlogopite for a suite of twelve rocks that were targeted to further unravel Seram's tectonic and metamorphic history. Despite a wide lithological and structural diversity among the samples, there is a remarkable degree of correlation between the 40Ar/39Ar ages recorded by different rock types situated in different structural settings, recording thermal events at 16 Ma, 5.7 Ma, 4.5 Ma, and 3.4 Ma. These frequently measured ages are defined, in most instances, by two or more 40Ar/39Ar ages that are identical within error. At 16 Ma, a major kyanite-grade metamorphic event affected the Tehoru Formation across western and central Seram, coincident with ultrahigh-temperature metamorphism and melting of granulite-facies rocks comprising the Kobipoto Complex, and the intrusion of lamprophyres. Later, at 5.7 Ma, Kobipoto Complex rocks were exhumed beneath extensional detachment faults on the Kaibobo Peninsula of western Seram, heating and shearing adjacent Tehoru Formation schists to form Taunusa Complex gneisses. Then, at 4.5 Ma, 40Ar/39Ar ages record deformation within the Kawa Shear Zone (central Seram) and overprinting of detachment faults in western Seram. Finally, at 3.4 Ma, Kobipoto Complex migmatites were exhumed on Ambon, at the same time as deformation within the Kawa Shear Zone and further overprinting of detachments in western Seram. These ages support there having been multiple synchronised episodes of high-temperature extension and strike-slip faulting, interpreted to be the result of Western Seram having been ripped off from SE Sulawesi, extended, and dragged east by subduction rollback of the Banda Slab.
1	Abstract   Household water supply problems remain one of the major challenges facing developing countries. In Malawi, there is lack of documentation on the levels and causes of water pollution particularly in peri-urban areas so that meaningful interventions can be adopted. Therefore, a study was carried out in South Lunzu Township a peri-urban area in the city of Blantyre.  The study revealed that the major form of sewerage disposal is the on-site sanitation system where about 58.8% of the respondents use traditional pit latrine while in terms of solid waste disposal, the Blantyre City Assembly which is responsible for solid waste collection, has only two collection vans to cater for more than half a million residents (Blantyre City Assembly, 1999. Urban Structure Plan, Draft Background Report, Blantyre.) hence indiscriminate disposal rampant in the area.  Water samples collected from the major sources of domestic water supply showed that there are variations in the levels of water pollution between the ground water and surface water sources and between the wet and dry season. For instance, physically, the ground water turbidity levels were in the range of 2–12 mg/l during the dry season but increased to a maximum of 114 mg/l during the wet season while for surface water the turbidity increased from 4 to 408 mg/l over the seasons compared to the WHO standard set at 5 mg/l and the Water Department standard set at 25 mg/l. Chemical pollution for surface water sources show seasonal variations with an increase in the concentration during the wet season, for instance, iron levels ranged from 2.3 to 4.03 mg/l. This is above the WHO and Water Department drinking standards which are 1 and 3 mg/l, respectively. However, bacteriologically both the ground water and the surface water sources are grossly polluted. Ground water spring coliform count ranged from 190/100 ml to 9500/100 ml, and the well 3500/100 ml to 11,000/100 ml having the maximum during the wet season. Surface water results also indicated the coliform count ranging from 2900/100 ml to 4600/100 ml way higher than the WHO, MBS standard for drinking water which is 0 and the Water Department standard for untreated water of which range from 10–50 coliforms/100 ml.  The results indicate that water resources have been polluted by lack of sanitation facilities, indiscriminate disposal of waste and the institutional set-up governing the provision of services in the area.
1	Background. Knee valgus load during sports movement is viewed as an important predictor of non-contact anterior cruciate ligament injury risk, particularly in females. Formulating movement strategies that can reduce valgus loading during these movements therefore appears pertinent to reducing anterior cruciate ligament injury rates. With this in mind, the current study examined the relationship between peak valgus moment and lower extremity postures at impact during a sidestep cutting task. Methods. Ten male and ten female NCAA athletes had initial contact three-dimensional hip, knee and ankle angles and subsequent knee valgus moment quantified during the execution of (n = 10 trials) sidesteps. Peak valgus data were normalized to mass and height and tested for the main effect of gender (ANOVA, P &lt; 0.05). Intra-subject correlations between the eight initial joint angles and the normalized valgus moment were then conducted across the ten sidestepping trials. The ensuing slopes of regression were submitted to a two-sample t-test to determine whether mean slope values were significantly different from zero and for the main effect of gender (P &lt; 0.05). Findings. Females had significantly larger normalized knee valgus moments than males. A greater peak valgus moment was associated with larger initial hip flexion and internal rotation, and with larger initial knee valgus angle. Peak knee valgus moment was more sensitive to initial hip internal rotation and knee valgus position in females. Interpretation. Training of neuromuscular control at the hip joint may reduce the likelihood of anterior cruciate ligament injury via a valgus loading mechanism during sidestepping, especially in females. � 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

1	Abstract   Background  Appropriate contour design of a femoral stem is important for the secure primary fixation. Although the relationship between the contour and stress or micro-motion at the fixation site has been analyzed, guidelines on stem design have not been established.    Methods  Different kinds of finite element models of three femoral stems were constructed for computer simulation. These models had the contour designs that head for the tight mechanical fixation by the different ways, respectively. Boundary and initial conditions were (i) rigid contact of the distal end of the model femur with the rigid base. (ii) Stepping load of 800 N or 1800 N was applied to the proximal top of the stem. (iii) Stepping load of 640 N or 1440 N was pulled from the greater trochanter of the femur as muscle force. The ratio of displacement to the vertical load, which was defined as fixation stiffness, was calculated.    Findings  The mean displacement of the intra-medullary cruciate stem was 27.6 nm. For the VerSys stem with sharp fins, the mean displacement was 32.9 nm. For the PerFix SV stem with a flange, the mean displacement was 52.8 nm. Vertical fixation stiffness estimated on the intra-medullary cruciate stem, the VerSys stem, and the PerFix SV stem was 461, 264, and 313 MN/mm, respectively.    Interpretation  Contour design of a femoral stem is important for achieving secure fixation, which prevents loosening. We introduce fixation stiffness as a measure to theoretically evaluate the primary fixation of femoral stems.
1	Abstract  Elderly patients with end stage renal diseases (ESRD) undergoing hemodialyis (HD) present poorer physical function and higher accident falls than healthy elderly population. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the HD-related changes in postural sway in ESRD patients, as an objective hallmark of their functional abilities. We hypothesized that the ESRD symptoms ( i.e.  uremic syndrome) and the HD therapy affected the postural control, evidenced by higher bounding limits of center-of-pressure (COP) velocity dynamics. Fifty-five participants, including 28 HD patients and 27 age, body mass index and gender-matched healthy participants H S  (70.42±13.69 years; 23.46±4.67kg/m 2 ; 35.7% women  vs.  73.62±6.59 years; 25.09±3.54kg/m 2 ; 37% women), were asked to maintain quiet stance on force platform, with eyes open and eyes closed. COP parameters were mean and standard deviation (SD) of position, velocity and average absolute maximal velocity (AAMV) in antero-posterior and medio-lateral directions. The results revealed a significant main effect of group on velocity-based variables, highlighting that mean velocity, SD velocity and AAMV ( p  S . These findings identified the bounding limits of COP velocity as an objective hallmark feature of HD-related changes in postural sway. The clinical assessment of this active control of COP velocity dynamics could be useful to examine the effects of targeted intradialytic exercise programs on functional performances and for early detection of increased fall risk in HD patients.
1	Purpose  Robust tissue characterization is essential for accurate dose calculation [1] ,  [2] . In this work, we present a novel method called Bayesian eigentissue decomposition (BETD)  [3]  to extract Monte Carlo inputs from computed tomography (CT) data having an arbitrary number of energies.    Method  Principal component analysis is applied on a reference dataset of human tissues to define eigentissues which are used as an optimal base of materials representing tissue compositions. To ensure robustness against CT noise, the Bayesian estimator is constructed and resolves the maximum a posteriori fraction of eigentissues in each voxel. The performance of the method in deriving proton beam interaction properties is evaluated with dual-energy CT (DECT) data and compared to a state-of-the-art elemental composition parameterization. Comparison is made with several levels of noise and in the presence of statistical variations in tissue composition and density. The performance of the BETD to an arbitrary number of energies is also investigated by simulating CT data with two to five energy bins with equivalent noise levels.    Results  Using simulated noise-free CT numbers for 43 reference soft tissues, the BETD and parameterization methods give equivalent results for stopping powers estimation (0.11% and 0.13% respectively). However, when noise and tissue variation are present, the BETD reduces the RMS error on stopping powers from 2.79% for parameterization to 1.88% for the proposed approach. The BETD method also shows potential for using CT with more than 2 energies, where a number of four energy bins is shown to reduce proton beam range uncertainty by a factor of up to 1.5 compared to the parameterization method used with DECT.    Conclusion  This work proposes a general approach to determine elemental compositions and density for Monte Carlo inputs using CT data in a clinical context, where noise and tissues variations significantly degrade the performance of currently known methods.
1	Abstract   The    F    and    G    form-factors of    K     l4     and the quark condensates are calculated to    O  (p     6   )    in Chiral Perturbation theory (CHPT). Full formulas are presented as much as possible. A full refit of most of the    O  (p     4   )    CHPT parameters is done with a discussion of all inputs and underlying assumptions. We discuss the consequences for the vacuum expectation values, decay constants, pseudoscalar masses and    π    –    π    scattering.
1	We present a general method for obtaining the quantum chromodynamical radiative corrections to the higher-twist (power-suppressed) contributions to inclusive deep-inelastic scattering in terms of light-cone correlation functions of the fundamental fields of quantum chromodynamics. Using this procedure, we calculate the previously unknown ${\cal O}(\alpha_s)$ corrections to the twist-three part of the spin scaling function $g_T(x_B,Q^2) (=g_1(x_B,Q^2)+g_2(x_B,Q^2))$ and the corresponding forward Compton amplitude $S_T(\nu,Q^2)$. Expanding our result about the unphysical point $x_B=\infty$, we arrive at an operator product expansion of the nonlocal product of two electromagnetic current operators involving twist-two and -three operators valid to ${\cal O}(\alpha_s)$ for forward matrix elements. We find that the Wandzura-Wilczek relation between $g_1(x_B,Q^2)$ and the twist-two part of $g_T(x_B,Q^2)$ is respected in both the singlet and non-singlet sectors at this order, and argue its validity to all orders. The large-$N_c$ limit does not appreciably simplify the twist-three Wilson coefficients.
1	Abstract   Based on an extended tanh-function method, a general method is suggested to obtain multiple travelling wave solutions for nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). The validity and reliability of the method is tested by its application to some nonlinear PDEs. The obtained results are compared with that of an extended tanh-function method and hyperbolic-function method. New exact solutions are found.
1	Abstract   We clarify the relationship and physical implications of different measures of entanglement and quantum particle correlation in a system containing indistinguishable particles. We also propose a subspace-restricted (due to superselection rules and/or space–time boundary conditions) entanglement measure and show that this measure is suitable to be used for describing the entanglement between qubits in quantum computer (QC) architectures involving identical particles.
1	The work deals with the modelling of a nonequilibrium spherical microwave discharge. An effect of the higher modes of the incident electromagnetic waves on the properties of the discharge plasma is investigated. Numerical experiments are carried out for the discharge in an argon at atmospheric pressure. Results are presented for the characteristics of the discharge plasma against the external parameters (the mode, frequency and power of the applied electromagnetic field and the size of the discharge chamber).
1	Abstract   We construct the geometro-hydrodynamical formalism for a spinning particle based on the six-dimensional manifold of autoparallelism geometry which is represented as a vector bundle with a base formed by the manifold of the translational coordinates and a fiber specified at each point by the field of an orthogonal coordinate frame underlying the classical spin. We show that the geometry of oriented points leads to the existence of torsion field with the source – the classical spin. We expand the geometro-hydrodynamical representation of Pauli field developed by Takabayasi and Vigier. We show that the external torsion field has a force effect on the velocity and spin fields via the spin-vorticity, which is characteristic of the space structure with the inhomogene triad field. The possible experimental effects of torsion field are discussed.
1	Abstract   We calculate the Holevo Cramer–Rao bound for estimation of the displacement experienced by one mode of an two-mode squeezed vacuum state with squeezing r and find that it is equal to    4  exp  ⁡  (  −  2  r  )   . This equals the sum of the mean squared error obtained from a dual homodyne measurement, indicating that the bound is tight and that the dual homodyne measurement is optimal.
1	Abstract   In the framework of the Constrained Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (CMSSM) we discuss the impact of the recent experimental information, especially from E821 Brookhaven experiment on  g   μ  −2 along with the light Higgs boson mass bound from LEP, to the dark matter direct searches. Imposing these experimental bounds, the maximum value of the spin-independent neutralino–nucleon cross section turns out to be of the order of 10 −8  pb for large values of tan β  and low  M  1/2 , m  0 . The effect of the recent experimental bounds is to decrease the maximum value of the cross section by about an order of magnitude, demanding the analogous sensitivity from the direct dark matter detection experiments.
1	Abstract   Using 3.3 pb −1  of data collected with the CMD-2 detector in the 720–840 MeV c.m. energy range, the branching fraction of the conversion decay    ω  →   π  0    e  +    e  −     has been measured:    B  (  ω  →   π  0    e  +    e  −   )  =  (  8.19  ±  0.71  ±  0.62  )  ×   10  −4    . The upper limits for the branching fractions of the following conversion decays have been obtained at the 90% confidence level:    B  (  ρ  →   π  0    e  +    e  −   )    1.6  ×   10  −5    ,    B  (  ρ  →  η   e  +    e  −   )    0.7  ×   10  −5     and    B  (  ω  →  η   e  +    e  −   )    1.1  ×   10  −5    .
1	Abstract   The multiplicity distributions produced by the variation of time-dependent gravitational fields in a conformally flat background geometry belong to the same class of infinitely divisible distributions found, for fixed center of mass energies and symmetric (pseudo)rapidity intervals, in charged multiplicities produced in  pp ,    p   p  ¯     and in heavy ion collisions. Apparently unrelated multiplicity distributions are classified in terms of the (positive) discrete representations of the    SU  (  1  ,  1  )    group. The gravitational analogy suggests a global high-energy asymptote for the distributions measured in  pp  and    p   p  ¯     collisions. Second-order cross correlations between positively and negatively charged distributions represent a relevant diagnostic for a closer scrutiny of the multiparticle final state.
1	Abstract   The negative results in the search for Kaluza–Klein graviton modes at the LHC, when confronted with the discovery of the Higgs, have been construed to have severely limited the efficacy of the Randall–Sundrum model as an explanation of the hierarchy problem. We show, though, that the presence of multiple warping offers a natural resolution of this conundrum through modifications in both the graviton spectrum and their couplings to the Standard Model fields.
1	Abstract   The longitudinal structure function of the    d(e,e′p)    exclusive cross section is calculated with the Lorentz integral transform method. In this approach final state interaction is fully taken into account, but without using a final state wave function. Cross sections are obtained via the inversion of the transform. It is shown that the inversion results are very stable. The comparison to a conventional calculation with an explicit    np    final state wave function shows that the obtained results are also very precise. Thus the method opens up the possibility to obtain exclusive cross sections for reactions with more than two particles, where it is generally very difficult to calculate the exact final state wave function.
1	Abstract   We introduce a method for constructing Darboux (or supersymmetric) pairs of pseudoscalar and scalar Dirac potentials that are associated with exceptional orthogonal polynomials. Properties of the transformed potentials and regularity conditions are discussed. As an application, we consider a pseudoscalar Dirac potential related to the Schrodinger model for the rationally extended radial oscillator. The pseudoscalar partner potentials are constructed under the first- and second-order Darboux transformations.
1	Abstract   We investigate torsion and noninertial effects on a spin-   1  /  2    quantum particle in the nonrelativistic limit of the Dirac equation. We consider the cosmic dislocation spacetime as a background and show that a rotating system of reference can be used out to distances which depend on the parameter related to the torsion of the defect. Therefore, we analyse torsion effects on the spectrum of energy of a nonrelativistic Dirac particle confined to a hard-wall potential in a Fermi–Walker reference frame.
1	Abstract   We present a map of the global mean lower cloud coverage of Venus. This map is the average of 35 nights of 2.26 μm night side observations taken at NASA's Infrared Telescope Facility on Mauna Kea, over the years spanning 2001–2007. The atmosphere of Venus is a very dynamic system, and the lower clouds are constantly changing [Crisp, D., Allen, D.A., Grinspoon, D.H., Pollack, J.B., 1991a. The dark side of Venus: near-infrared images and spectra from the Anglo-Australian Observatory. Science, 253, 1263–1266]. By studying average cloud coverage, the daily variations are suppressed in order to see the underlying persistent cloud pattern. We find a relatively thick but highly variable equatorial band of clouds (±20° in latitude) and more quiescent mid-latitude clouds that are less opaque on average, with persistent cloudiness near the poles. We show that there is enough variation between our daily observations or between observations taken in different months that they cannot be considered individually representative of the global mean. We also compare the cloud coverage map to the topography of Venus and find no definitive correlations with high altitude features.
1	Abstract   Extravehicular activity (EVA) of astronauts during space missions is simulated nowadays underwater in neutral buoyancy facilities. Certain aspects of weightlessness can be reproduced underwater by adding buoyancy to a diver-astronaut, therefore exposing the subject to the difficulties of working without gravity. Such tests were done at the COMEX’ test pool in Marseilles in the 1980s to train for a French–Russian mission to the MIR station, for the development of the European HERMES shuttle and the COLUMBUS laboratory. However, space agencies are currently studying missions to other destinations than the International Space Station in orbit, such as the return to the Moon, NEO (near-Earth objects) or Mars. All these objects expose different gravities: Moon has one sixth of Earth’s gravity, Mars has a third of Earth’s gravity and asteroids have virtually no surface gravity; the astronaut “floats” above the ground. The preparation of such missions calls for a new concept in neutral buoyancy training, not on man-made structures, but on natural terrain, underwater, to simulate EVA operations such as sampling, locomotion or even anchoring in low gravity. Underwater sites can be used not only to simulate the reduced gravity that astronauts will experience during their field trips, also human factors like stress are more realistically reproduced in such environment.  The Bay of Marseille hosts several underwater sites that can be used to simulate various geologic morphologies, such as sink-holes which can be used to simulate astronaut descends into craters, caves where explorations of lava tubes can be trained or monolithic rock structures that can be used to test anchoring devices (e.g., near Earth objects). Marseilles with its aerospace and maritime/offshore heritage hosts the necessary logistics and expertise that is needed to perform such simulations underwater in a safe manner (training of astronaut-divers in local test pools, research vessels, subsea robots and submarines).  COMEX is currently preparing a space mission simulation in the Marseilles Bay (foreseen in June 2012), and the paper will give an overview of the different underwater analogue sites that are available to the scientific community for the simulation of surface EVA or the test of scientific instruments and devices.
0	Ultrasonic non-destructive testing systems designed to control huge structures normally use several transducers in the reception stage. To avoid increasing the cost of electronics, a multiplexer is used to send all received signals to the same processing module. Traditionally, transmission of such signals is carried out using copper cables. For special applications (i.e. continuous monitoring of nuclear plants) metallic cables are not suitable because of their high sensitivity to electromagnetic perturbations. Moreover, the multiplexing is made electronically. When the distance between the transducers and the reception unit is large and/or electromagnetic noise is important, signal degradation takes place. The proposed system implements the transmission and multiplexing of ultrasonic electrical signals obtained by means of broadband transducers (up to 1 MHz), using an optical fiber. Optical fibers are made of dielectric materials (silica or plastic) so they are inherently passive to electromagnetic noise. Wavelength division multiplexing is utilized for adding channels to the system by means of fiber optic couplers and different light sources. The wavelengths of the optical signals utilized are located far apart in the optical spectrum in order to avoid serious crosstalk in transmission. The limit to the number of multiplexed channels depends on the optical fiber selected, the spectrum of the light sources and the wavelength division multiplexers or couplers utilized.
1	Abstract   We present the results of a comparative study performed with three numerical methods applied to a flow in a three-dimensional geometry characterized by weak compressibility and large rarefaction effects. The employed methods, all based on the kinetic theory of gases, are the Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) in a regularized formulation, the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) approach and a hybrid method coupling the LBM and the DSMC recently developed by Di Staso et al., in this contribution extended to the case of simulations involving many particles and three-dimensional geometries. Owing to the common kinetic nature shared by the employed methods and to their implementation in a single code infrastructure, a detailed comparison of the results can be performed on a quantitative ground. The numerical results permit to determine, for the studied flow problem, the range of applicability in terms of a geometry-based Knudsen number for the present LBM formulation. The need to employ the hybrid method is justified by the very large computational cost of the DSMC simulation. Limitations of the current hybrid method formulation in treating thermal and large compressibility effects are underlined and possible strategies to overcome them are delineated. Finally, good scalability properties of the parallel algorithms, as well as the large computational cost reduction guaranteed by the hybrid method, while providing an accurate solution, are demonstrated.
1	Effective field theory provides a systematic approach to hardon physics and few-nucleon systems. It allows one to determine the effective two-, three-, and more-nucleon interactions which are consistent with each other. We present a project to derive bulk properties of nuclei from the effective nucleonic interactions.
0	Abstract   The endcap calorimeter of the CMD-2 detector for the VEPP-2M collider is described. The calorimeter consists of 680 BGO crystals, arranged in two endcaps. The light readout is performed by vacuum phototriodes. For the energy of incident photons from 100 to 700 MeV the energy resolution is 4–8% and angular resolution is 0.02–0.03 rad in agreement with MC simulation.
1	Abstract   We present experimental results for a traveling wave resonant ring in a low-duty beam test and a high-duty RF test. In the low-duty beam test, we studied the RF characteristics of the traveling wave resonant ring and measured the multiplication factor, M, and conversion efficiency, η. We obtained multiplication factors of 3.2 under no beam loading and 2.2 under a beam loading of 100 mA and these were in good agreement with calculations. A high conversion efficiency of 0.74 was achieved by using the traveling wave resonant ring. In the high-duty RF test, we measured the multiplication factor as a function of phase shifter position and temperature of the traveling wave resonant ring. From the experimental results, we calculated the variation of the phase shifter position to a temperature rise. Understanding this variation is necessary to keep the multiplication factor at the maximum for the design point 20% duty operation.
0	Abstract   Large area and miniature microstrip detectors were processed by Micron Semiconductor Ltd on oxygenated silicon and non-oxygenated material. The pre-irradiation and post-irradiation IV and inter-strip capacitance values all agree between the control devices and those with enhanced oxygen. After irradiation, the capacitance-voltage (CV) derived depletion voltage for the oxygenated detector is lower than that for the control device. However, the difference appears less marked than is typically seen with diodes. The charge collection properties were studied with 1064 nm laser and minimum ionising electrons (m.i.p.'s) from a  106 Ru source, with a good agreement between light-spot and source data. We found evidence for improvement in oxygenated detectors from this run with this supplier but again, not as pronounced as might be expected from the diode studies.
1	A new collimator for thermal neutrons, based on the honeycomb design, has been produced in a few prototype versions. The method of construction is simple and the overall cost of the device is rather low. Development of this collimator has been stimulated by the technical specifications of the spectrometer BRISP for thermal neutron Brillouin scattering, presently under construction. The performances of the prototypes have been measured on the monochromatic beam of a steady source and exploiting the time-of-flight technique at a pulsed neutron source. The expected response of the device has been calculated by means of a Monte Carlo simulation of the experiments. This paper describes the method of construction and reports on the results of the neutron test measurements in comparison with the Monte Carlo simulation.
1	Abstract   The CEBAF large acceptance spectrometer (CLAS) is used to study photo- and electro-induced nuclear and hadronic reactions by providing efficient detection of neutral and charged particles over a good fraction of the full solid angle. A collaboration of about 30 institutions has designed, assembled, and commissioned CLAS in Hall B at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility. The CLAS detector is based on a novel six-coil toroidal magnet which provides a largely azimuthal field distribution. Trajectory reconstruction using drift chambers results in a momentum resolution of 0.5% at forward angles. Cherenkov counters, time-of-flight scintillators, and electromagnetic calorimeters provide good particle identification. Fast triggering and high data-acquisition rates allow operation at a luminosity of    10     34     nucleon    cm     −2     s     −1    . These capabilities are being used in a broad experimental program to study the structure and interactions of mesons, nucleons, and nuclei using polarized and unpolarized electron and photon beams and targets. This paper is a comprehensive and general description of the design, construction and performance of CLAS.
1	The center of gravity as an algorithm for position measurements is analyzed for a two-dimensional geometry. Several mathematical consequences of discretization for various types of detector arrays are extracted. Arrays with rectangular, hexagonal, and triangular detectors are analytically studied, and tools are given to simulate their discretization properties. Special signal distributions free of discretized error are isolated. It is proved that some crosstalk spreads are able to eliminate the center of gravity discretization error for any signal distribution. Simulations, adapted to the CMS em-calorimeter and to a triangular detector array, are provided for energy and position reconstruction algorithms with a finite number of detectors.
1	The main design principles of a multispectrum, multimethod spectrum evaluation application are described. The data handling allows to build refined and complex data evaluation models and thus to investigate complex problems using fine and established methods quickly, without the need of writing highly specialized spectrum data evaluation programs for the individual data evaluation tasks. The program is flexible and user friendly, equipped with XPS specific evaluation facilities. Only procedures published in refereed journals are implemented, typically several methods for solving the same task, thus allowing to compare different data evaluation methods on the same experimental data. The provided data evaluation methods involve simultaneous evaluation of experimental data taken at different experimental parameters or spectral data resulting from different experimental investigations, too. The used multi-platform base package allows to build and run the application on practically all popular platforms today. The application is available for free from its Web site.
1	Conventional dose distribution study for gamma irradiation facility involves the use of isodose maps. The establishment of these maps requires the measurement of the absorbed dose in many points, which makes the task expensive experimentally and very long by simulation. However, a lack of points of measurement can distort the dose distribution cartography. To overcome these problems, we present in this paper a mathematical method to describe the dose distribution in air. This method is based on the multipole expansion in spherical harmonics of the photon flux emitted by the gamma source. The determination of the multipole coefficients of this development allows the modeling of the radiation field around the gamma source.
1	X-ray coherent scattering can be attractive for noninvasive quantification and to provide complementary information to discriminate between cortical and trabecular bone tissue. Both laboratory X-ray source and synchrotron have been used in the study of the potential application of scattering information for imaging of mineral content in bone. Initially, a powder diffractometer was used. The scattering profiles were obtained using a Shimadzu DRX 6000 diffractometer at the Nuclear Instrumentation Laboratory, Brazil. The second coherent X-ray scattering measurements were carried out at the X-Ray Diffraction (XRD1) beamline located at the D12A bending-magnet port at the National Synchrotron Light Laboratory (LNLS) in Campinas, Brazil. The results obtained on the two machines are compared to each other. For both experiments, a good agreement can be seen between the bone calibration curves plotted. Although the data obtained from both machines were produced with the same statistical uncertainty, the acquisition time using synchrotron radiation was about 10 times smaller.
0	Abstract   We focus our attention on the low ion velocity stopping mechanisms in a multicomponent and dense target plasmas built of quasi-classical electron fluids neutralizing binary ionic mixtures such as deuterium–tritium of current fusion interest, proton-helium like iron in the solar interior or proton-helium ions considered in planetology, as well as other mixtures of fiducial concern in the heavy ion beam production of warm dense matter at Bragg peak conditions. The target plasma is taken in a multicomponent dielectric formulation a la Fried-Conte. We stress out the occurrence of projectile ion velocities (so-called critical) for which target electron slowing down equals that of the given target ion components.  The corresponding multi-quadrature computations, albeit rather heavy, can be monitored analytically through a very compact code operating a PC cluster.  Slowing down results are systematically scanned w.r.t. target temperature, electron density as well as ion composition.
1	Abstract   Compensation for gamma-ray background is of great importance in tritium measurements with ionization chambers. Three kinds of ionization chamber systems are often used to cancel the gamma background: base to base model, coaxial model and differential model. Monte Carlo method is employed to evaluate the compensation ability of all the three models and the compensation character of each model is also specified in this paper. Ionization chambers are modeled with MCNP5 code and the absorbed dose is calculated. Results turn out that chambers arranged in coaxial model can compensate most gamma background from any direction and any distance but with complex structure. The compensation ability varies greatly with directions and distances for both base to base model and differential model.
0	Abstract   Molecular plating is a widely used technique for the preparation of lanthanide and actinide targets. We have studied the growth and surface morphology of uranium films during the molecular plating process using atomic force microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, Raman and IR spectroscopy and X-ray fluorescence. During deposition of U films on 10 μm Al backings by molecular plating, the RMS roughness increased from 17 to 446 nm for deposition times up to 45 min and then decreased to 223 nm for deposition times of 120 min, which gave the smoothest films with a fractal dimension of 2.10.
1	Abstract   The HERA luminosity was determined by measuring the flux of bremsstrahlung photons emitted at zero degree off electrons in the field of protons in the interaction region. After the HERA upgrade, the H1 Collaboration developed a new luminosity system which measured all the emitted photons in a bunch crossing. We describe the expression of this photon flux in the luminosity detector which is used in the simulation of the detector. The total energy method, based on the measurement of the bremsstrahlung photon energy flux in the calorimeter, is the standard method for the off-line luminosity measurement. In this study, we propose a new method to calculate the luminosity. This new method is based on the shape of the bremsstrahlung photon energy spectrum measured in the luminosity detector. The two methods are compared. A good agreement is observed.
0	Abstract   The FOXFIRE project (Feasibility Of a Xenon detector with Front-end for Ionization Real-time Extraction) aims at the realization of a Liquid Xenon TPC optimized for high rate particle physics experiments, in particular in the field of rare event searches, with particles in the 10–100 MeV energy range. Liquid Xenon has several attractive properties to be exploited resulting in superior time and energy resolution, by using the scintillation light readout with suitable photo-detectors. A novel approach with a complementary TPC readout scheme can improve the space resolution to a level of a few hundred microns. We are studying both the feasibility of a light readout with higher granularity by means of Silicon PhotoMultipliers optimized for the Xenon emission spectrum as well as on an innovative micro-fabricated device capable of charge multiplication in liquid phase. The detector will be equipped with a readout electronics capable of online reconstruction of events, allowing the detector to sustain a high rate of interactions.
0	Abstract   A program has been initiated to measure the energy dependence of selected high-yield fission products used in the analysis of nuclear test data. We present out initial work of neutron activation using a dual-fission chamber with quasi-monoenergetic neutrons and gamma-counting method. Quasi-monoenergetic neutrons of energies from 0.5 to 15 MeV using the TUNL 10 MV FM tandem to provide high-precision and self-consistent measurements of fission product yields (FPY). The final FPY results will be coupled with theoretical analysis to provide a more fundamental understanding of the fission process. To accomplish this goal, we have developed and tested a set of dual-fission ionization chambers to provide an accurate determination of the number of fissions occurring in a thick target located in the middle plane of the chamber assembly. Details of the fission chamber and its performance are presented along with neutron beam production and characterization. Also presented are studies on the background issues associated with room-return and off-energy neutron production. We show that the off-energy neutron contribution can be significant, but correctable, while room-return neutron background levels contribute less than      1  %    to the fission signal.
1	Abstract   Construction was completed during summer 2013 on the Telescope Array RAdar (TARA) bi-static radar observatory for Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECR). TARA is co-located with the Telescope Array, the largest “conventional” cosmic ray detector in the Northern Hemisphere, in radio-quiet Western Utah. TARA employs an 8 MW Effective Radiated Power (ERP) VHF transmitter and smart receiver system based on a 250 MS/s data acquisition system in an effort to detect the scatter of sounding radiation by UHECR-induced atmospheric ionization. TARA seeks to demonstrate bi-static radar as a useful new remote sensing technique for UHECRs. In this report, we describe the design and performance of the TARA transmitter and receiver systems.
0	Author(s): Gourlay, SA | Abstract: © 2018 Elsevier B.V. Superconducting magnets for accelerators were first suggested in the mid-60’s and have since become one of the major components of modern particle colliders. Technological progress has been slow but steady for the last half-century, based primarily on Nb–Ti superconductor. That technology has reached its peak with the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Despite the superior electromagnetic properties of Nb3Sn and adoption by early magnet pioneers, it is just now coming into use in accelerators though it has not yet reliably achieved fields close to the theoretical limit. The discovery of the High Temperature Superconductors (HTS) in the late ’80’s created tremendous excitement, but these materials, with tantalizing performance at high fields and temperatures, have not yet been successfully developed into accelerator magnet configurations. Thanks to relatively recent developments in both Bi-2212 and REBCO, and a more focused international effort on magnet development, the situation has changed dramatically. Early optimism has been replaced with a reality that could create a new paradigm in superconducting magnet technology. Using selected examples of magnet technology from the previous century to define the context, this paper will describe the possible innovations using HTS materials as the basis for a new paradigm.
0	Abstract   The low-temperature (LT) superstructure of NaV2O5 was determined by synchrotron radiation X-ray diffraction. Below the phase transition temperature at    34    K   , the LT structure is monoclinic. It was determined that the LT structure is (a−b)×2b×4c with the space group A112, where a, b and c represent the high-temperature orthorhombic unit cell. The valence estimation of V ions shows that the V sites are clearly separated into two groups of V4+ and V5+ with a zigzag charge-ordering pattern.
1	Abstract   In many fields of applied physics, the space-time phenomena to be studied may be described in the following way: events of random amplitudes occur randomly in time. We investigate some statistical properties of this model, with special emphasis on situations where the model for the waiting time between consecutive events or the amplitude of individual events are fractal (power-law) distributions with infinite mean value (the rareness or extreme event hypothesis). Limit laws for cumulative partial sums and the extremal process are characterized. Using asymptotical results on backward and forward recurrence times, limit laws are investigated for the physically realistic situation when the cumulative process is only observed starting from some non-zero observational time.
1	Abstract   The paper aims to investigate influences of norms on a space-time dynamic of stirred (solutions) and non-stirred (lattices) collectives of very simple believing agents. A mental state of an agent is characterized by agent's belief in some proposition and a truth value of the proposition in agent's local vicinity. Every agent of the collective updates its belief depending on its current belief, belief of its closest neighbours and truth value of the proposition in neighbourhood of the neighbours. Each agent is represented by a finite automaton – a so-called doxaton [A. Adamtzky, Appl. Math. Comput., in press]. The doxaton takes five doxastic states, derived from the belief: knowledge, doubt, misbelief, delusion and ignorance. In the above mentioned reference, we defined a binary composition of doxastic states and investigated its algebraic structure. The composition itself is not deterministic; however, it can be made deterministic by applying norms. The norms are expressed in a priority order on the doxastic states. Space-time evolution of the solutions and the lattices of doxatons is studied in computer experiments to understand influences of norms and initial conditions on the behaviour of abstract collectives of simple agents. Diffusion and reaction of doxastic states are explored as well as formation of stationary patterns of the doxastic states.
1	Abstract   Geophysical materials such as sea ice, rocks, soils, snow, and glacial ice are composite media with complex, random microstructures. The effective fluid, gas, thermal, and electromagnetic transport properties of these materials play an important role in the large-scale dynamics and behavior of many geophysical systems. A striking feature of such media is that subtle changes in microstructural characteristics can induce changes over many orders of magnitude in the transport properties of the materials, which in turn can have significant large-scale geophysical effects. For example, sea ice, which mediates energy transfer between the ocean and atmosphere, plays a key role in global climate, and serves as an indicator of climatic change, is a porous composite of ice, brine and gases. Relevant length scales range from microns and millimeters for individual brine structures, to centimeters and meters for connected brine channels across floes, to hundreds of kilometers across an ice pack. Sea ice is distinguished from many other porous composites, such as sandstones or bone, in that its microstructure and bulk material properties can vary dramatically over a relatively small temperature range. The fluid permeability of sea ice ranges over six orders of magnitude for temperatures between 0°C and −25°C. Moreover, small changes in brine volume fraction around a threshold value of about 5%, corresponding to variations in temperature around a critical point of about −5°C, control an important transition between low and high fluid permeability regimes. Below this critical temperature, the sea ice is effectively impermeable, while for higher temperatures the brine phase becomes connected over macroscopic scales, allowing fluid transport through the ice. This transition has been observed to impact a wide range of phenomena such as surface flooding and snow–ice formation, enhancement of heat transfer due to fluid motion, mixing in the upper ocean, melt pool persistence, surface albedo (ratio of reflected to incident radiation) and other optical properties, growth and nutrient replenishment of algal and bacterial communities living in sea ice, and remote sensing of the sea ice pack from space. Recently, we have shown how continuum percolation theory can be used to understand the critical behavior of fluid transport in sea ice. Here we review this application of percolation theory to sea ice, and briefly discuss electromagnetic transport in sea ice, in particular how the geometry and connectivity of the brine microstructure determine its effective complex permittivity.
1	Abstract   Chaos synchronization can be achieved by several methods but there is no easy unified criterion in general. In this paper, a general scheme is proposed to achieve chaos synchronization via stability with respect to partial variables. Three theorems for synchronization of unidirectional coupled nonautonomous (also autonomous) systems by linear feedback are developed for systems with and without system structure perturbations. The system, fly-ball governor, is demonstrated as an example.
1	Abstract   We present two models for an epidemic where the individuals are infective over a fixed period of time and which never becomes endemic i.e., no infective individuals remain after the epidemic has run its course. The first model is based on a delay-difference scheme. We show that, as a function of the delay (which corresponds to the period of infectiveness) the percentage of non-infected population varies over a wide range. We present also a variant of our model where the recovery rate follows a Poisson law and obtain a discrete version of the SIR model. We estimate the percentage of non-infected population in the two models, show that they lead to almost the same values and present an explanation of this fact. The second model is based on the assumption that the infection is spread by carriers. Under the hypothesis that the carriers are relatively long-lived, and that the number of the infected ones is a relatively small fraction of the total population of potential carriers, we show that the model reduces to the same version of the discrete SIR obtained by our first model.
1	Abstract   The theory of energy transfer in rare earth-doped materials is developed in relativistic language that is formulated within the concept of  L − S  coupled states. The approach is defined by means of Sandars and Beck’s transformation of inter-shell unit tensor operators to their relativistic form expressed by  doubly effective double  tensor operators. The tensorial structure of the new effective operators is analyzed, and new selection rules for the non-vanishing contributions to the energy transfer amplitude are presented.
0	The size effect of nanoparticles on optical properties of Lu2O3:Eu3+ was investigated. No pronounced effect was observed for structure of emission spectra. It was found that effect is mainly manifested in the decay profiles of Eu3+ emission. We have noticed that the decay times were almost the same for low concentrations of Eu3+ ions. It is concluded that the size effect is associated with agglomeration of Eu3+ in nanorange particles.
0	Abstract   The MmNi 3.55 Co 0.75 Mn 0.4 Al 0.3 B  x   hydrogen storage alloys with various boron contents of  x =0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 were prepared by a radio frequency levitation melting process. The electrochemical kinetics such as linear polarization, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and anodic polarization were investigated. Such experimental results showed that the addition of boron could enhance the activation performance and the rate capability. With the increase of boron additive such a favorable effect became more pronounced.
0	Abstract   In this work, fabrication and characterization of a single-mode vinyltriethoxysilane (VTES) based hybrid organic–inorganic sol–gel ridge waveguide is reported. VTES based hybrid sol–gel material has been deposited by multiple spin-coating process on quartz substrate. Channel waveguides have been fabricated by UV photopolymerization followed by wet etching process. Optical guided mode was observed to ensure the single mode condition while cut-back technique was performed for loss propagation measurement. Optical propagation losses were measured to be 1.6 dB/cm at 1.31 μm wavelength. This value shows that this material is a promising choice for the development of integrated optical circuits for telecommunication field.
1	Abstract   An optical fiber curvature sensor based on a pressure-induced birefringence singlemode fiber loop mirror is presented. The birefringer SMF is made by applying a transverse force against a short length of singlemode fiber. The length of the sensing element for the curvature sensing is about 150 mm. The sensitivity of the curvature measurement experimentally is 0.0263 m −1 /pm. And the temperature effect of the proposed sensor is also analyzed. Comparing with the sensor of photonic crystal fiber, it is more convenient and simply.
1	Abstract   In this article, we demonstrate a unique hexagonal lattice structure of Photonic Crystal Fiber for liquid sensing applications. Relative sensitivity, confinement loss and birefringence of the structure have been investigated theoretically. The numerical inquiry has been taken place using the full vectorial Finite Element Method (FEM). We have shown a comparative performance analysis between two lattice structures of the proposed Photonic Crystal Fiber. It is found that the presence of elliptic air holes instead of circular air holes in the core region and the innermost ring of the cladding bring higher birefringence with high sensitivity and low confinement loss. According to the simulated results, at 1.33 μm operating wavelength, the birefringence, confinement loss, and relative sensitivity of the suggested PCF are 2.825 × 10−3, 2.07 × 10−6 dB/m and 43.84% respectively for Ethanol filled core.
0	Summary   The ability to prepare inorganic nanocrystals with well-defined morphologies and sharp faces should facilitate the examination of their facet-dependent surface, catalytic, electrical, and other properties. In this review we cover different synthetic methods for the growth of Cu 2 O nanocrystals with morphological control. Cu 2 O nanocrystals with cubic, cuboctahedral, truncated octahedral, octahedral, and multipod structures have been prepared mainly by wet chemical, electrodeposition, and solvothermal synthesis methods. Methods used for the formation of hollow Cu 2 O nanocubes, octahedra, and truncated rhombic dodecahedra are also presented. Morphology of Cu 2 O nanocrystals can be expanded with the use of gold nanocrystal cores to guide the overgrowth of Cu 2 O shells. Surface properties of Cu 2 O nano- and microcrystals with sharp faces have been examined in a few studies. The {1 1 1} faces were found to interact well with negatively charged molecules, while the {1 0 0} faces are less sensitive to molecular charges. Preferential adsorption of sodium dodecyl sulfate molecules on the {1 1 1} faces of Cu 2 O crystals has been demonstrated via plane-selective deposition of gold nanoparticles on only the {1 0 0} faces. It is expected that the development of improved synthetic methods for Cu 2 O nanocrystals and more knowledge of their facet-dependent properties should lead to their applications in photoactivated energy conversion and catalysis.
1	Abstract   Error threshold is the upper bound of the mutation rate such that the genetic information can pass on during reproduction. In Eigen’s original proposal, the fitness landscape consists of a single peak along with other background sequences. However, realistic fitness landscapes are far more complicated and thus obstruct deeper understanding from either analytic or numerical approaches. Here we propose a variational approach to derive the error thresholds in generic fitness landscapes. When applying to the Eigen model, it delivers the correct error threshold and reveals the scaling relations between relevant parameters. For the fitness landscape with a peak–mesa profile, the two-dimensional phase diagram in the mesa fitness and the mutation rate can be computed with minimal cost. When the mesa fitness is larger than some critical value, upon increasing the mutation rate, the quasispecies changes from the peak to the mesa and then dissolves into the random background. The phase boundaries can be computed analytically within the effective-fitness approximation. At the end, the universal phase diagram in terms of the rescaled variables is explained in detail.
1	Abstract   The influence of different sucrose concentrations (0, 100, 200, 300, 400 mM) in the aqueous phase on the bending elasticity modulus, kc, of a lipid membrane was studied using the analysis of thermally induced shape fluctuations of giant quasispherical vesicles. Stroboscopic illumination was applied to cancel the effect of the camera integration (smearing) and to improve the precision of the measurement (almost two-fold). The experiment confirmed that the sucrose reduces the bending elasticity modulus of the lipid membrane. We established a difference in the values of the bending elasticity modulae, obtained by thermally induced shape fluctuations method and micropipette technique [V. Vitkova, J. Genova, M. D. Mitov, I. Bivas, Sugars in the aqueous phase change the mechanical properties of lipid mono- and bilayers, Mol. Cryst. Liq. Cryst., in press] and this difference depends on the sucrose concentration. It was experimentally shown that SOPC vesicles electroformed in 300 and 400 mM sucrose concentration in the water phase do not show any aging effect after a period of 3–9 days after the formation.
1	Field investigations have been carried out in two 60-day stages on the surf beat low frequency waves in Anzali port, one of the main commercial ports in Iran, located in southwest coast of the Caspian Sea. The characteristics of significant water waves were measured at three metering stations in the sea, one at the entrance of the port and three in the basin. The measured data were inspected to investigate the surf beat negative effects on the tranquility of the port. Using field measurements and complementary numerical modeling, the response of the basin to the infra-gravity long waves was inspected for a range of wave frequencies. It was concluded that the water surface fluctuations in the port is strongly related to the incident wave period. The long waves with periods of about 45s were recognized as the worst cases for water surfaceperturbation in the port. For wave periods higher than the mentioned range, the order of fluctuation was generally low.
1	The occurrence of quench cracking in small cuboidal samples of aluminium alloy AA7150 was determined to be related to the maximum temperature difference (∆Tmax) between various locations within samples during quenching. When ∆Tmax between different locations is between 96 and 124 °C, there is some risk of quench cracking under various quenching conditions. When the ∆Tmax value is higher than 124 °C, quench cracks cannot be avoided. Quench cracks preferentially occur at sample corners and edges and are preferentially propagating in the short transverse direction–long transverse direction plane. Finite element modelling results indirectly indicate that the quench cracking should occur at the very early stages of the quenching process. Microscopy reveals that the quench cracking mode is intergranular, and cracks preferentially occur at high-angle grain boundaries with an average misorientation angle of ~42°. Moreover, quench cracks can penetrate through the whole thickness of a sample quenched from 495 into 20 °C water. Fractography reveals that no constituent particles exist in the quench fracture region, indicating that, unlike impact fracture, the occurrence of quench cracks is not dependent on the presence of coarse particles.
0	This article describes the post-annealing treatment of a rutile thin film, which was fabricated on a quartz glass substrate by heat treating a precursor film in air for 15–60 min by using a process involving a Ti complex of EDTA. The transparent, crack-free rutile thin films thus obtained were characterized by means of X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and field emission scanning electron microscopy. The photoluminescence emission band of the post-annealed rutile thin films appeared at ca. 800 nm, which is in the extraordinary low-energy region, although no emission band in the region could be observed for the rutile thin film before annealing. It was revealed that the extraordinary emission band of the thin films at 800 nm is strongly related both to the orientation of the constituent crystals along the (110) plane and to the incorporation of O atoms into the O-defect sites that were in the rutile thin film before the post-annealing treatment.
0	Friction stir welding is a new solid state joining technology, which is suitable for joining some hard-to-weld materials, such as aluminum alloy, magnesium alloy, etc. The modeling of material flows can provide an efficient method for the investigation on the mechanism of friction stir welding. So, 3D material flows under different process parameters in the FSW process of 1018 steel are studied by using rate-dependent constitutive model. Numerical results indicate that the border of the shoulder can affect the material flow near the shoulder–plate interface. The mixture of the material in the lower half of the friction stir weld can benefit from the increase in the angular velocity or the decrease in the welding speed. But flaws may occur when the angular velocity is very high or the translational velocity is very small. When the angular velocity applied on the pin is small or the welding speed is high, the role of the extrusion of pin on transport of the material in FSW becomes more important. Swirl or vortex occurs in the tangent material flow and may be easier to be observed with the increase in the angular velocity of the pin.
0	This work describes the investigation of the corrosion evaluation of UNS S31803 duplex stainless steels aged at low temperatures using double loop electrochemical potentiokinetic reactivation tests (DLEPR). A wrought duplex stainless steel (DSS) UNS S31803 was aged at four temperatures in the 350—550°C range for times up to 1000 h. The hardening and embrittlement effects due to aging were also determined. An important decrease in corrosion resistance was observed in the samples aged at 475 and 550°C, but the samples aged at 350 and 400°C were not affected. Healing was observed in the samples aged for long times (1000 h at 475°C and 500 h at 550°C).
1	Slip velocities of unfilled and talc-filled polypropylene (PP) compounds, detectable at the die wall during pressure driven shear flow, have been determined using capillary rheometry. The presence of low molar mass, polar additives is responsible for the detection of wall slip in unmodified PP. Slip velocity increases with shear stress, beyond the critical onset condition. Increasing talc concentration in the PP compounds reduces slip velocity systematically, according to the talc volume fraction, whilst talc particle morphology appears to modify the wall slip behaviour to a greater extent than particle size. In comparison to PP-talc composites based on untreated filler, the presence of surface coatings tends to increase wall slip velocity, at any given shear stress, when the coating concentration exceeds monolayer level. These observations are explained in terms of a mechanism for wall slip in a low cohesive strength interphase, rich in low molar mass amide species, close to the flow boundary. This behaviour has also been modelled using a power law, to define wall slip parameters as a function of shear stress and talc concentration that can be used to enhance process simulation. It is demonstrated that the onset and magnitude of wall slip may be controllable by compound formulation and process conditions, creating exploitation potential to enhance process control and product properties of particle-modified PP composites.
1	A modified Monte Carlo method is proposed to simulate the two-dimensional normal grain growth in polycrystalline thin films. With the newly modified method, not only the simulation efficiency is improved but also the simulated time exponent of grain growth attained n = 0.49 ± 0.01, which is very close to the theoretical value for steady grain growth n = 0.5. Simulation of the complete process of normal grain growth including the steady state is made possible by means of the present method. The grain size distribution in the simulated thin films was found to vary continuously and slowly with time, the gamma and the Hillert functions may be two of the expression forms during its transition, and the latter corresponds to quasi steady grain growth. The so called “self-similarity” of the grain size distribution during the normal grain growth in two-dimensions is also discussed according to the simulation results.
1	High-density polyethylene (HDPE) pipe is now being used as an alternative to medium-density polyethylene (MDPE) for gas, water, sewage and waste-water distribution systems. Laboratory tests appear to show that HDPE is more able to suppress rapid crack propagation (RCP), whilst remaining sufficient resistance under the operational circumstances that lead to the type of slow crack growth observed in service failures. There have been many fractographic studies on MDPE pipe materials, actual pipe and fittings, but little on HDPE. A fractographic study of the type of HDPE pipe in current production has been undertaken. For these tests, whole pipe sections were subjected to either static or dynamic internal (water) pressurization fatigue loading. Failure mechanisms are discussed based on the fracture morphologies resulting from these tests. A further argument for good resistance of HDPE pipe to RCP is suggested. © 1998 Chapman &amp; Hall
0	Dark striations are often observed on the surface of iron–zinc coated steel sheet annealed immediately after hot-dip galvanizing (galvanneal). The striations can be explained on the basis of the differential formation of an iron–aluminium barrier layer at the steel-bath interface during galvanizing. The contact of a submerged, grooved sink roll in the galvanizing bath with the steel sheet causes variations in the iron–aluminium barrier layer at the interface. A more coherent layer is formed in the areas where there is no contact i.e., the grooved areas on the sink roll. The growth of the iron–zinc coating under a higher local aluminium concentration during subsequent annealing leads to a pitted surface in those groove areas, and creates the appearance of dark striations on the surface of the coated sheet. The aluminium content of the galvanizing bath is a key factor in determining the extent of the non-uniformity imposed by the contact with the sink roll. Consequently the striations can be reduced by lowering the aluminium content of the galvanizing bath.
1	The deformation behaviour of single crystal texture HDPE has been examined in tension as a function of the orientation of the tensile axis with respect to the chain direction. Over most of the orientation range examined, it was found that slip processes parallel to the chain direction were the dominant modes of deformation. Fibrillar slip becomes relatively more important than chain slip as the strain increases and as θ0, the initial value of the angle between the tensile axis and the chain direction, decreases. Lamellar slip was only observed over a limited range of orientations due to the high initiation stress required for the process. At low θ0 values, lamellar separation accounted for a substantial part of the applied strain. Stress-induced martensitic transformation, which was observed in samples with θ0&gt;26°, cannot account for an important fraction of the strain although the resolved shear stress required for the activation of the martensitic transformations is of the same order of magnitude as that required for chain slip.
0	The compression tests were carried out by Gleeble-1500 thermo-mechanical simulator with samples of semi-solid ZCuSn10 alloy prepared by strain-induced melt activation (SIMA) process. The original microstructure and the deformation temperature of semi-solid ZCuSn10 alloy are different. The strain is 0.2, and the strain rate is 1 s−1 for the compression test. The results show that when the semi-solid ZCuSn10 alloy was prepared by SIMA process, the liquid fraction of semi-solid microstructure increases, and the solid grain is smaller, more uniform and more inclined to be round as the rolling pre-deformation increasing. The results also indicate that the deformation resistance of ZCuSn10 alloy in semi-solid state decreases with the deformation temperature increasing or the solid fraction of original microstructure decreasing. The stress–strain curves of the isothermal compression can be divided into quasi-elastic deformation stage and plastic deformation stage, and there are three deformation zones in the samples after isothermal compression, namely the difficult deformation zone, the large deformation zone and the free deformation zone. In the three deformation zones, the main deformation mechanism is flow of liquid incorporating solid particles (FLS) mechanism, plastic deformation of solid particles (PDS) mechanism and liquid flow (LF) combining with FLS mechanism, respectively.
0	The silver cladding for high-temperature superconducting wire can be modified for various applications by alloying. For example, for powder-in-tube wire, stiffer cladding improves the smoothness of the interface. For large coils, higher strength is needed at low temperatures to hold them together. Power applications require more resistance in the cladding. We have made a survey of the properties of alloys to check their feasibility for various applications. Alloys with several elements added to silver have been prepared and evaluated for hardness, electrical properties, and compatibility with high-temperature superconductors during processing.
0	We have grown thin carbon films by pulsed laser deposition and have investigated the extent to which the properties of such films, as well as the processes responsible for these properties, are laser wavelength dependent. Films were grown by ablating material from a graphite target onto room temperature Si(100) substrates with 1064 and 248 nm laser radiation. The films were analyzed byin situ electron energy loss spectroscopy and byex situ Raman spectroscopy. The results indicated that films grown with 1064 nm ablation were graphitic, while those grown with 248 nm radiation were diamond-like. We have also examined the mass and kinetic energy distributions of the particles ejected from graphite by the two laser wavelengths. The results indicated that irradiation of graphite with 1064 nm laser radiation results in the ejection of a series of carbon cluster ions C n + (1 ≤ n ≤ 30) with mean kinetic energies less than 5 eV. Ablation of graphite with 248 nm radiation results in the ejection of primarily C 2 + and C 3 + with mean kinetic energies of 60 and 18 eV, respectively. These results suggest that large, low energy clusters produce graphitic films, while small, high energy clusters produce films of diamond-like carbon.
0	The hot rolled AA3104 ingot was cold rolled to 40%, 66%, 80% and 90% reductions. The cold rolled sheet was subsequently recrystallized at two different annealing temperatures of 573 K and 773 K. The bulk texture developments, both deformation and subsequently after recrystallization, were measured by X-ray ODFs (orientation distribution function), while recrystallized (and in few cases the partially recrystallized or recovered) samples were studied by SEM-EBSD (scanning electron microscope based electron backscattered diffraction).
0	A series of Co/CeO2 (25 nm) nanocomposite coating materials by electrodeposition were successfully prepared containing different cerium oxide composition in the cobalt-plating bath. Stainless steel (304L) was used as support material for nanocomposite coatings. The nano-CeO2 is uniformly incorporated into cobalt matrix, and the effect on surface morphologies was identified by scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray analysis. Codeposition of nano-CeO2 particles with cobalt disturbs the regular surface morphology of the cobalt coatings. It should be noted that the as-prepared Co/CeO2 nanocomposite coatings were found to be much superior in corrosion resistance over those of pure cobalt coatings materials based on a series of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements in simulating body fluid solution. With increase in the nano-CeO2 particles concentration in the cobalt electrolyte, it is observed that the corrosion resistance of Co/CeO2 increases. Co/CeO2 nanocomposite coatings have higher polarization resistance as compared with pure cobalt layers in simulating body fluid solution.
0	During the cyclic deformation of \( [\bar{5}79] \), Al single crystals with a high stacking fault energy produced slip bands that were characterized by wavy slip. Its cyclic stress response curve demonstrated that the specimen experienced hardening–softening–secondary hardening in sequence with repeated fluctuation stresses usually less than 10 MPa, which is far lower than those of Cu, Ni, and Ag single crystals. Finally, the whole surface of the Al single crystals was covered with intense intrusion and extrusion, and the cell structure is the most typical dislocation arrangement. These cells mainly comprise loose clusters of dislocations, which move more freely. In the center of the cell, the dislocation density is relatively low, and most dislocations concentrate in the cell wall. At room temperature, compared with cyclically deformed Cu, Ni, and Ag single crystals, the cyclic deformation behaviors of Al single crystals show significant differences, which are highlighted in this study.
0	The quality of chemically synthesized few-layered graphene, which is known as reduced graphene oxide (RGO) depends on the oxidation of graphite, effective exfoliation of graphite oxide and complete reduction of graphene oxide. Herein, we report the preparation of nitrogen doped RGO by a modified Hummer’s method using potassium manganate along with potassium permanganate to achieve improved oxidation of graphite and a small amount of bovine serum albumin as a dispersant to avoid restacking of graphene sheets. Besides reducing the agglomeration of graphene layers, bovine serum albumin also serves as a nitrogen dopant. The quality of as-prepared nitrogen doped RGO is examined by morphological and structural studies. While microscopic studies confirm the formation of thin, well dispersed RGO sheets, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic studies confirm the doping of nitrogen in RGO. A specific surface area of 286 m2 g−1 is obtained for nitrogen doped RGO, which is mainly contributed by the basal planes and ordered mesoporosity of RGO. The capacitance properties of as-prepared nitrogen doped RGO without any conductive additive are evaluated by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge–discharge cycling. A specific capacitance of 142 F g−1 obtained at a current density 1 A g−1 is almost twice the specific capacitance obtained for commercial graphene platelet aggregates (75 F g−1). The rate performance of as-prepared nitrogen doped RGO is comparable to that of commercial graphene platelet aggregates. It is also found that nitrogen doped RGO electrode can be charged and discharged for at least 2000 cycles without fade in the capacitance.
0	To the best of our knowledge, there is no single crystalline γ-MnOOH nanotube materials synthesized through one-step approach so far. A facile, one step route was developed to synthesize γ-MnOOH nanotubes. The structure and texture features of materials were analyzed by XRD and BET nitrogen sorption respectively, while the morphologies were characterized by FESEM. Electrochemical experiment results demonstrate that the γ-MnOOH nanotubes should be a good candidate as electrode material for supercapacitors.
0	One-dimensional Co3O4 nanowires have been prepared by utilizing the ordered mesoporous silica material SBA-15 as template. The results of transmission electron microscope (TEM) and N2 adsorption–desorption characterizations show that the Co3O4 nanowires possess a uniform size and a large Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area. Its electrochemical performance was investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) techniques in various concentration of KOH solution. This nanomaterial shows a small resistance, a high specific capacitance (SC), and a strong cyclic stability. The maximal SC value of 373 F·g−1 was obtained in 6 M electrolyte under the scan speed of 3 mV·s−1 at the first CV cycle. After 500 CV cycles, the SC value is about 90% of the original value. It is considered that the short path of ion transfer given by nanomaterial brought on the great pseudo capacitance performance.
0	In the present paper, Ti doped ZnO films with higher conductive properties were grown on room temperature glass substrates by radio frequency magnetron sputtering and followed by annealing in vacuum. The microstructures and surface figures of the films were investigated by X-ray diffraction and scanning electronic microscopy, and its optical and electrical properties were measured using a four-point probe technique and 756-type spectrophotometer at room temperature. The results show that the preferred growth orientation of the films is (002) orientation, and after annealing in vacuum at 400 °C for 3 h, the average transmittance reduces from 90 to 80%, and resistivity reduces from 4.53 × 10−2 to 8.78 × 10−4 Ω cm.
1	Aspects of numerical results from computational experiments on representative volume element (RVE) problems using finite element analyses are discussed. Two different boundary conditions (BCs) are examined and compared numerically for volume elements with different sizes, where tests have been performed on the uniaxial tensile deformation of random particle reinforced composites. Structural heterogeneities near model boundaries such as the free-edges of particle/matrix interfaces significantly influenced the overall numerical solutions, producing force and displacement fluctuations along the boundaries. Interestingly, this effect was shown to be limited to surface regions within a certain distance of the boundaries, while the interior of the model showed almost identical strain fields regardless of the applied BCs. Also, the thickness of the BC-affected regions remained constant with varying volume element sizes in the models. When the volume element size was large enough compared to the thickness of the BC-affected regions, the structural response of most of the model was found to be almost independent of the applied BC such that the apparent properties converged to the effective properties. Finally, the mechanism that leads a RVE model for random heterogeneous materials to be representative is discussed in terms of the size of the volume element and the thickness of the BC-affected region.
1	A pH/thermo-responsive hydrogel with porous structure (HME), composed of poly(N-acryloylglycine methyl ester), poly(N-acryloylglycine ethyl ester) and sodium alginate (SA) was prepared for the controllable drug carrier. The resultants, CO2 and CaCl2 from the reaction of CaCO3 particles and HCl act as pore-forming and crosslinking of SA, respectively. The porous HME was characterized by differential scanning calorimetry, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and surface area and porosity analysis. The sheet, porous structure was clearly observed by the SEM measurement and the specific surface area of HME was evidently increased with an increase of CaCO3 content. At pH 2.1 phosphate buffered saline (PBS), the release amount of caffeine at room temperature was only 7.2 % within 600 min, while this value approached to 65.3 % at pH 7.4 PBS. Additionally, the cumulative release at 37 °C is much higher than that at room temperature due to the thermo-sensitivity of HME. The experimental results indicated that porous HME has a potential to be used as the promising release-controlled drug carrier in the biomedical fields.
1	The application of fine powders in thermal spray technology represents an innovative approach to apply dense and smooth near-net shape coatings on tools with complex geometry. However, this aim can only be achieved as long as the influence of the handling parameters of the spray process, such as the spray angle, is sufficiently understood. In this study, the influence of the spray angle on the deposition rate as well as on the coating properties (microhardness, roughness, and porosity) of HVOF-sprayed, fine-structured coatings are investigated. A fine, agglomerated, and sintered WC-12Co powder (agglomerate size: 2-10 μm, WC-particle Fisher sub-sieve size = 400 nm) was used as feedstock material. It has been shown that HVOF spraying of fine powders is less susceptible to an alteration of the spray angle than most other thermal spray processes such as plasma- or arc-spraying. The reduction of the spray angle results in a decrease in the deposition rate, while no significant degradation of the coating properties is found up to 30°. However, at spray angles below 30° the coating strength is negatively affected by the formation of pores and cracks.
0	High-temperature thermal fatigue causes the failure of thermal barrier coating (TBC) systems. This paper addresses the development of thick TBCs, focusing on the microstructure and the porosity of the yttria partially stabilized zirconia (YPSZ) coating, regarding its resistance to thermal fatigue. Thick TBCs, with different porosity levels, were produced by means of a CoNiCrAlY bond coat and YPSZ top coat, both had been sprayed by air plasma spray. The thermal fatigue resistance of new TBC systems and the evolution of the coatings before and after thermal cycling was then evaluated. The limit of thermal fatigue resistance increases depending on the amount of porosity in the top coat. Raman analysis shows that the compressive in-plane stress increases in the TBC systems after thermal cycling, nevertheless the increasing rate has a trend which is contrary to the porosity level of top coat.
0	The paper reports the synthesis of Ba1−xSr x TiO3 (BST) for x = 0.20, 0.25, and 0.30 via hydroxide co-precipitation route to result into the BST nanoparticles of size nearly 50 nm. The La0.67Sr0.33MnO3 (LSMO) is also synthesized using co-precipitation route to achieve nanocrystaline particles. Further, the magnetodielectric (MD) composites of BST0.20, BST0.25, and BST0.30 are formed by addition of the LSMO at y = 0.1 and 0.2. The parent BST compositions are analysed for its dielectric properties. The composite LSMO-BST (LBST) is investigated for the variation of dielectric constant and impedance spectra as a function of applied magnetic field for the frequency between 500 Hz to 1 MHz. The observations on MD effect show that the dielectric constant possesses contributions due to magnetic field dependant interfacial polarization and variations due to the induced stress.
0	Cement samples made of β-tricalcium phoshate (β-TCP), phosphoric acid (PA) and water mixtures were incubated in several aqueous solutions to determine their stability over time. The effects of the cement composition and the incubating temperature were investigated in more detail. The cement samples contained mostly dicalcium phosphate dihydrate (DCPD) and remnants of β-TCP crystals. Depending on the initial cement composition, a certain amount of dicalcium phosphate (DCP) crystals were formed. The larger the initial PA concentration, the larger the DCP amount. After setting, the cement composition was stable for at least 16 days up to 60 °C. Above that temperature, the DCPD crystals decomposed into DCP crystals. The latter reaction provoked a decrease of the pH of the incubation solution, phenomenon expected for a cement sample containing an excess of PA. As the cement samples contained an excess of β-TCP, it was postulated that β-TCP crystals became so covered by DCP or DCPD crystals during setting that the setting reaction was stopped prematurely. The latter phenomenon gave a good explanation for the low pH values measured in the incubation solutions. ©©2000 Kluwer Academic Publishers
0	Microstructural evolution, hardness, and shear strength of the cast plates of GZ31 magnesium alloy were investigated after friction stir processing (FSP). Due to severe plastic deformation and dynamic recrystallization, FSP breaks the dendrites and results in a fine homogenous structure in the stirred zone (SZ) having average grain sizes of about 4.0 and 2.5 μm in the one and two-pass FSPed plates, respectively. As a novel approach, strength of the processed plates was examined by shear punch testing in three regions of the SZ on the surface layer, namely, center line (CL), retreating side (RS), and advancing side (AS). FSP showed great potential in the enhancement of SZ ultimate shear strength from 114 to about 152 and 155 MPa in the one and two-pass FSPed materials, respectively. The same trend was observed in hardness values of the SZ, where the average hardness of the base material increased from 41 to 60 and 68 Vickers after one and two passes of FSP, respectively. The variations in the shear strength of the CL, RS, and AS zones of the SZ were about 5% for the first pass of FSP, the effect which was decreased to less than 2% after two passes of FSP.
0	Edge failure during stretching of sheared edges limits the use of sheet steels in a number of product applications. The shearing process causes a highly strained region adjacent to the shear face, called the shear-affected zone. In the present study, the strain-hardening rate at uniform elongation, Z, is used as an empirical measure of cohesive strength at the interface of the various phases in steel microstructures. The higher the value of Z, the lower the macro strain when voids begin to form that lead to decohesion of the interface and subsequent failure. The data from four different studies are used to show that the true circumferential strain at failure in a hole expansion is a direct function of Z for most microstructural conditions. Sheet steels that exhibit better performance than that which would be expected for their Z values have one or more of the following characteristics—an increase in ferrite strength, lower carbon martensite in DP steels, or TRIP steels. A hot-rolled ferrite/pearlite microstructure is the only case of decreased true circumferential strain at failure for a given value of Z.
0	The influence of nitrogen in shielding gas on the corrosion resistance of welds of a duplex stainless steel (grade U-50), obtained by gas tungsten arc (GTA) with filler wire, autogenous GTA (bead-on-plate), electron beam welding (EBW), and microplasma techniques, has been evaluated in chloride solutions at 30 °C. Pitting attack has been observed in GTA, electron beam welding, and microplasma welds when welding has been carried out using pure argon as the shielding gas. Gas tungsten arc welding with 5 to 10% nitrogen and 90 to 95% argon, as the shielding gas, has been found to result in an improved pitting corrosion resistance of the weldments of this steel. However, the resistance to pitting of autogenous welds (bead-on-plate) obtained in pure argon as the shielding gas has been observed to remain unaffected. Microscopic examination, electron probe microanalysis (EPMA), and x-ray diffraction studies have revealed that the presence of nitrogen in the shielding gas in the GTA welds not only modifies the microstructure and the austenite to ferrite ratio but also results in a nearly uniform distribution of the various alloying elements, for example, chromium, nickel, and molybdenum among the constitutent phases, which are responsible for improved resistance to pitting corrosion.
0	We present experiments and theory on the diluted melt dynamics of monodisperse entangled polymers of linear, star and H-shaped architecture. Frequency-dependent rheological data on a series of progressively diluted linear, star and H-polymers are in good agreement with a refined tube-model theory that, for H-polymers, combines star polymer melt behaviour at high frequency, with linear polymer reptation behaviour at low frequencies. Taking into account the effect of dilution via some simple scaling relations, mild polydispersity and by incorporating the high frequency Rouse modes, we are able to model quantitatively the entire frequency range. This work suggests a novel rheological route to analysing long chain branching in polymer melts.
0	Nanomaterials preparation has undergone great development in recent years, with important applications. The adsorbent properties of these nanomaterials cannot be always done using batch studies, because the nanometric particle size often hinders its physical separation, and this may affect the conclusions regarding adsorption studies. A new and simple method was developed, based on electrochemical measurements. For the validation process, synthetic alumina was used as adsorbent with copper solutions. The solid/solution ratio was kept constant in both the electrochemical and batch methods, optimizing in each case the adsorption equilibration time. Peak current versus Cu2+ concentration linearity was assessed from voltammograms. The electrochemical adsorption was accomplished utilizing cyclic voltammetry before and after the addition of the adsorbent. The amount of sorbed element was determined from the difference between the amount of Cu2+ added and that present in solution at equilibrium. The Langmuir, Freundlich, and Langmuir–Freundlich models were used to fit the experimental data obtained by both methods. The results of the electrochemical methodology have precision and accuracy statistically comparable to those obtained with the batch method. The electrochemical technique has the advantage of shorter adsorbent/adsorbate equilibration times than batch and do not require physical separation, allowing the adsorption on the imogolite to be established.
0	We report a novel scheme for investigat- ing the emission on the surface of silica depending on different excitation wavelengths and accompanied photochemical reactions. Silica nanospheres with a typical feature of quality fractal are fabricated by drying out the hydrolysates of tetraethylorthosilicate in alcohol-absent aqueous solution. The residual organic groups sustain a comparatively stable surface system, kinetically hindering the relaxation of the defect structures. This surface state provides stable and intermediate energy states to accommodate the excitation electrons. Multiphoton processes accelerate the dissociation energy of the Si-O bond and there- fore, greatly decrease the photoreaction threshold of photochemical reactions. Thus, different radiation energy stimulates different photochemical processes and thereby creates different luminescence centers on the surface of silica. It becomes possible to tune the position of the emission band by adjust the excitation conditions. The study is significant not only in control and adjusts the surface defects, but also in color- tunable optoelectronic nanodevice.
0	Although the aqueous electroless etching (AEE) method has received significant attention for the fabrication of silicon nanowires (SiNWs) due to its simplicity and effectiveness, SiNWs grown via the AEE method have a drawback in that their surface roughness is considerably high. Thus, we fabricated surface-modified p–n + junction SiNWs grown by AEE, wherein the surface roughness was reduced by a sequential processes of oxide growth using the rapid thermal oxidation (RTO) cycling process and oxide removal with a hydrofluoric acid solution. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy analysis confirmed that the surface roughness of the modified SiNWs was significantly decreased compared with that of the as-fabricated SiNWs. After RTO treatment, the wettability of the SiNWs had dramatically changed from superhydrophilic to superhydrophobic, which can be attributed to the formation of siloxane groups on the native oxide/SiNW surfaces and the effect of the nanoscale structure. Due to the enhancement in surface carrier mobility, the current density of the surface-modified p–n + junction SiNWs was approximately 6.3-fold greater than that of the as-fabricated sample at a forward bias of 4 V. Meanwhile, the photocurrent density of the surface-modified p–n + junction SiNWs was considerably decreased as a result of the decreases in the light absorption area, light absorption volume, and light scattering.
0	Yttria doped zirconia based are the most important solid electrolytes for high temperature solid oxide fuel cell application. In this study, the tetragonal/cubic zirconia composite thin films are prepared by combination of aqueous tape casting and net shape method. The phases and microstructure of the samples are studied by X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscope respectively. The microhardenss and toughness of thin films are measured by Vickers microhardness test. The nanohardness and Young’s modulus of the specimens are evaluated by nanoindentation method. The electrical conductivity is determined by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy method. It is found that the composite electrolyte with 25 wt% of tetragonal phase content has improved mechanical and electrical properties at low temperatures and can be a suitable electrolyte for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells.
0	Semiconductive secondary phase CuO was introduced into SrTiO3 ceramic matrix to yield dielectric composite ceramics with high dielectric constant. The dense composite ceramics could be obtained by sintering at 1050°C in air for 3 h, in which the co-presence of SrTiO3 and CuO/Cu2O was confirmed. The dielectric constant of the present composite ceramics increased firstly and then decreased with increasing the content of CuO, and the highest dielectric constant was obtained at x = 0.4. There were steps and peaks on the curves of dielectric constant vs temperature and dielectric loss vs temperature, respectively, and the peak temperatures of dielectric loss indicated the Debye-type relaxation.
0	Metal or oxide electrodes (Pt, Au, Ag, (La, Sr)CoO3) were deposited on single crystals of 0.02 mol% Nb doped SrTiO3 by pulsed laser deposition. Current-voltage and capacitance-voltage responses were measured using three-terminal electrode configuration. Under high oxygen partial pressures, clear rectification behaviors were observed. Diffusion model well explained the current vs. voltage relationship with ideality factors close to unity. The barrier height varied reversibly with oxygen partial pressure, and was almost independent of the electrode materials, which suggested that the Fermi level at the interface was pinned by the surface states. The origin of the surface states was discussed in terms of oxygen adsorption or oxidative formation of metal vacancies around the surface. Chemical interaction between the surface and oxygen and resulting cation rearrangement was concluded to play an important role from the long stabilization time on oxygen partial pressure change. The water vapor pressure dependence of the barrier height was also explained by competitive adsorption of oxygen and water.
0	Raman spectroscopy was used to investigate the compressive fragmentation process and the interface behavior in ultra high modulus (UHM) (750 GPa Modulus) pitch-based graphite/polypropylene composites upon cooling from processing temperature to room temperature. It is found that bulging is the primary mechanism of failure in these fibers, and Raman peak position measurements show that not all visually detected features represent real fiber failure. However, at real break locations, the fiber strain is found to drop to zero.
0	The microstructural evolution and distribution rules, such as dynamic recrystallization (DRX) volume fraction, dynamically recrystallized grain size, and average grain size, in multiway loading-forming process of AISI 5140 steel triple valve body have been investigated using numerical simulation, combined with the analytic method by considering the influences of process parameters including loading speed of punch, initial temperature of billet, and friction. The results show that the DRX volume fraction increased, and its distribution became more uniform with the increases of punch loading speed and billet initial temperature, or the decrease of friction factor; the dynamically recrystallized grain size decreased, and its distribution was more uniform, with the increases of punch loading speed and friction factor, or the decrease of billet initial temperature; the average grain size decreased, and its distribution became more uniform with the increases of punch loading speed and billet initial temperature, or decrease of friction factor.
0	Predictions of liquid metal viscosities have been made using the Born-Green equation. The pair potential was calculated by the Percus-Yevick and hypernetted chain equations with the predicted structure factor and was used with the Mie-Gruneisen potential to make the calculations. Instead of using an experimentally determined radial distribution curve, however, an adjustable hard sphere radial distribution curve is employed to obtain the pair potential. The first peak of the hard sphere radial distribution curve used here was adjusted to represent the radial distribution curve at the melting point for any liquid metal. This was done by using the number of nearest neighbors and the distance to the first maximum in the radial distribution curve. This is possible because of the similarities in the radial distribution curves of liquid metals. A temperature correction is employed so that the viscosities can be calculated over a wide temperature range. The results are compared with literature values.
0	Results are presented for an experimental study of the effect of screw rolling of solid billets on mechanical properties and macrostructure of T grade wheel steel. It is shown that piercing of continuous billets with a drawing factor λ = 1.6 makes it possible to work a cast structure, improve ductility properties, and impact load resistance.
0	It is shown that goethite (yellow ferrie oxide pigment) synthesis by an ammoniacal method offers a suitable means of obtaining, from technical iron vitriol, high-purity ferric oxide with stable properties fulfilling the requirements for ferrite-grade ferric oxide. The ferric oxide is distinguished by its high reactivity after high-temperature (850–900°C) heat treatment. Its physicochemical properties are close to those of 1360 WF grade ferric oxide manufactured by the Bayer Co. of West Germany [5]. The key process parameters in the production of ferric oxide by this method are: goethite synthesis pH 4.0–4.5, synthesis temperature 70–75°C, amount of seed 8–10% of the goethite content at the end of synthesis, and ferric oxide calcining temperature 850–900°C.

The phase diagram of the system boron-silicon was replotted, and some properties (microhardness, electrical conductivity, thermo-emf) of boron-silicon alloys were investigated.
0	Phosphogypsum-slag-clink (PSC) cement were prepared by original phosphogypsum(PG), which was grinded after dried at 60 °C combined with different contents of phosphogypsum (15%, 20%, 30%), and a small amount of different C3A, C4AF contents of finely ground cement clinker, and ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBFS). Physical mechanical and sugaring properties were studied. The results show that compressive strength of PSC cement with 20% phosphogypsum at 3 d ages would be higher than 17 MPa and even 50 MPa at 28 days. Compressive strength at longer curing stage and sugaring properties of PSC with lower content of C3A higher C4AF clinker were improved. pH value of PSC cement system at early stage was relatively low, and pH gradually increased with the addition of clinker. pH increased firstly and then decreased with the hydration stage. SEM analyses showed that the amount of ettringite, which was influenced by pH and content of Al, must be controlled in PSC cement system, which may cause damage to microstructure or even expansive cracks if large amount of ettringite formed in hardened paste.
1	The ibuprofen-rectorite composites were prepared by the solution intercalation method using ibuprofen and rectorite as raw materials, and were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, Fourier transform infrared analysis and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The experimental results show that the ibuprofen is intercalated into the interlayer spaces of rectorite. The values of the (001) peaks of the ibuprofen-rectorite composite are larger than that of Na-rectorite and reach the largest when the reaction time and ibuprofen amount is 2 h and 0.36 g, respectively. The layered structure of Na-rectorite is destroyed to some extent with the intercalation of ibuprofen into the interlayer space in the structure of Na-rectorite. A part of ibuprofen in the ibuprofen Na-rectorite covers on the surface of Na-rectorite besides some ibuprofen enters into the interlayer space.
0	The article shows that for the description of the creep resistance curves of heat-resistant materials two dependences have to be used: Dorn's modified relation and the Larson-Miller relation (with constant C close to 20), the latter being realized on nickel alloys and some steels in the region of high stresses. A mixed case is being considered. It is shown that the model corresponds to a broad range of experimental data.

0	The deformation, stability and vibration equations for anisotropic cylindrical shells stiffened with individual longitudinal and circumferential ribs are derived without introducing the hypothesis of nondeformable normals. The more general assumption adopted for layered materials (for example, glass-reinforced plastics) of a linear variation of the displacements over the thickness of the shell and the height of the ribs is used; in this case for the points of contact of the shell and the ribs after deformation the common normals form broken lines. The solution of the problem of the stability of a cylindrical shell stiffened with circumferential ribs is examined. For a shell with different, arbitrarily located ribs the problem is reduced to a homogeneous algebraic system of equations equal in number to three times the number of ribs.
0	A fracture model consisting of a set of bonds assigned various stress concentration coefficients is proposed. The bond lifetime is determined from Zhurkov's equation; the relative number of bonds with a particular γ* being taken in accordance with a Weibull distribution. The model explains the similarity of the shapes of the submicrocrack accumulation and creep curves.
0	The technique of ultrahigh-resolution nonlinear fluorescent microscopy based on standing surface plasmons is proposed. On the wavelength of a surface plasmon of 20 nm the expected lateral resolution should be 1–2 nm. Slow surface plasmons with the required mean free path of ∼1 m are possible in the planar amplifying medium-metal-dielectric structures due to the compensation of loss in the metal by the amplification in the active medium. In the optical and near infrared range the undamped surface plasmons with the wavelength of 20–50 nm in thin silver films can be obtained at the material gain of active medium of (1–2) × 104 cm −1. Possibilities of obtaining this gain in the plasmon structures remain to be seen.

The use of surfactants improves the granulometric composition of the batch, its gas permeability, and hence the sintering efficiency. The use of surfactant is most effective with optimal wetting of the batch (7–8%), with consumption of the experimental binder at a rate of 1.2–1.6 L/h. (The surfactant concentration in aqueous solution is 0.3⎯0.4 mL/L.)

0	The work presents the results of recent studies of nanostructured titanium and its alloy of the grade VT-6 (Ti-6Al-4V), in which we managed, using the methods of severe plastic deformation (SPD), to obtain ultra-fine-grained (UFG) states and form other nanostructured elements as nanodispersed particles of secondary phases, nonequilibrium grain boundaries, and dislocation substructures. Special attention was paid to equal-channel angular pressing (ECAP) and its modifications in combination with thermal and thermomechanical treatments, which enable one to obtain UFG alloys in the form of elongated rods. The peculiarities of grinding the microstructure in titanium and binary alloy VT-6 in dependence on the deformation technological setup have been established. The principles of nanostructuring to enhance strength, plasticity, and fatigue life have been suggested. The results of studies of the mechanical properties of the UFG VT-6 alloy have demonstrated the high efficiency of its application in the manufacture of articles with enhanced service parameters on the example of compressor blades of a gas-turbine engine (GTE). The possibilities of scaling the ECAP process to implement the commercial manufacture of the new material have been examined.
0	This article describes X-ray crystal structure analysis of N-(5-oxo-2-thioxoimidazolidin-1-yl)thiophene-2-carboxamide monohydrate (1). The title compound crystallizes in the triclinic space group P#N#                                                                                                    $$ \overline{1} $$#N#                   with a = 6.5688(6), b = 7.9479(7), c = 10.8830(8) A, α = 102.343(7), β = 94.837(7), γ = 100.309(7)°, and Z = 2.

Moreover, Hirshfeld surface analysis was used for visually analyzing intermolecular interactions in crystal structures. The title compound is the 2-thiohydantoin derivative. Its molecular and crystal structure was compared and discussed with amino and hydrate analogs.
0	The blending of lithium ion insertion compounds is a novel and promising approach to design advanced electrodes for future secondary batteries. Recently, considerable improvements regarding power density and safety issues have been achieved by combining several insertion compounds. However, the understanding of basic interactions between the constituents of the blend is still ongoing. In the present theoretical study, we derive a mathematical model of the reversible heat generation rate of a blended insertion electrode based on the thermodynamic properties of its constituents. The reversible heat is found to be a function of the entropy of the lithium insertion reaction, the mass fraction, and the differential capacity of each constituent in the blend. The impact and the significance of these parameters on the reversible heat generation rate and its state of charge dependence are analyzed. The derived relations can be used to determine the reversible heat profile of a blended insertion electrode for all possible compositions if the properties of the pure constituents are known. The results suggest the opportunity of designing specific reversible heat profiles by a targeted compilation of the blend.
0	The syntheses, physicochemical properties and catalytic activity of Cu-containing catalysts in the hydrogenolysis of glycerol are reported in the present paper. The investigated catalysts contained various amounts of Cu deposited by wet impregnation over two oxide supports: Al2O3 and TiO2. The catalysts were characterized by the following techniques: XRD, H2-TPR, BET/BJH and N2O adsorption. The catalytic activity of the prepared catalysts was studied in the selective hydrogenolysis of glycerol to 1,2-propanediol in order to understand the role of the support as well as to select the most active and selective catalyst. The influence of the following parameters was carefully studied: pre-reduction temperature, hydrogen pressure during pre-reduction and hydrogenolysis and reaction time. In addition, the influence of tungstophosphoric acid and sodium hydroxide additives was also studied. The best catalytic systems were identified in terms of glycerol conversion and 1,2-propanediol selectivity.
0	In this study, the solid state synthesis and reaction kinetics for Co/B as a catalytic/acidic accelerator for sodium borohydride (NaBH4) hydrolysis were investigated. The Co/B a catalytic/acidic accelerator was synthesized from cobalt(II) chloride hexahydride (CoCI2·6H2O) and boron oxide (B2O3) by a procedure based on solid state synthesis. Differential thermal analyses (DTA) were performed on mixtures of CoCI2·6H2O and B2O3 at four different heating rates (5, 10, 15 and 20 °C min−1) in order to determine the solid state reaction temperatures. Kissinger and Doyle kinetic models were applied to the reaction kinetics data for the solid state preparation. The ideal temperature for the solid-state synthesis of Co/B catalytic/acidic accelerator was 196 °C. Additionally, the catalytic behavior of solid state synthesized Co/B as an catalytic/acidic accelerator for NaBH4 hydrolysis was investigated. The hydrolysis reactions were performed at temperatures of 22, 40, and 60 °C and the experimental data were fitted to zeroth, first, and second order kinetic models. The maximum hydrogen generation rate was 5,470 ml H2 min−1 g−1 cat and Ea was only 48.07 kJ mol−1.
1	In this report, we present experimental results on evanescent optical field (EOF) interaction with 85Rb vapor atoms. A circularly polarized EOF, 780 nm in wavelength, optically pumps the 85Rb atoms from its upper ground state to its D2 excited state. A probe beam connecting the lower ground state of D2 transition stimulates emission of radiation from the excited atoms, which indicates additional atomic population excited by the circularly polarized EOF. Theoretical analysis and experimental results indicate that the circularly polarized EOF excites the D2 transition from 85Rb(52S1/2, F = 3, m F = ±1) ground state to excited state (52P3/2, F’ = 3, m F = 0) that creates an additional population to this state, which can be detected with the help of a probe laser beam.
0	We report on a nanostructured polysiloxane as a coating for solid-phase microextraction (SPME) of chlorobenzenes from water, wastewater, sludge and sediment samples. Methyltriethoxysilane was used to prepare the nanostructured fibrous polysiloxane coatings, which were deposited onto a stainless steel wire. Headspace SPME, followed by GC with electron capture detection was applied for separation and quantitation. The effects of stirring rate, salt concentration, equilibrium and extraction time, extraction temperature, desorption time and temperature were optimized. The extraction efficiency of the analytes using the new fiber was 5–10 and 10–30 times better than those obtained by using the commercial PDMS fiber and nonfibrous polysiloxane fiber, respectively. The relative standard deviations for intra- and inter-day precision for a single fiber were below 6 %. The fiber to fiber reproducibility was in the range of 3.3–9.7 % (for n = 3). The detection limits were between 0.15 and 75 ng L−1. The relative recoveries for water, wastewater, sludge, and sediment samples were in the range from 90 to 99 %.
1	This study describes the development and validation of a highly sensitive and specific enzyme immunoassay (EIA) for therapeutic monitoring and pharmacokinetic studies of atorvastatin (ATR). The assay employs a polyclonal antibody that recognizes ATR with high specificity and affinity, and ATR conjugated to bovine serum albumin (ATR-BSA) immobilized onto microwell plates as a solid phase. The assay involved a competitive binding reaction between ATR and the immobilized ATR-BSA for the binding sites on a limiting amount of the anti-ATR antibody. The bound anti-ATR antibody was quantified with horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-immunoglobulin secondary antibody and 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine as a substrate for the peroxidase enzyme. The concentration of ATR in the sample was quantified by its ability to inhibit the binding of the anti-ATR antibody to the immobilized ATR-BSA and subsequent color development in the assay wells. The conditions for the EIA were investigated and optimized for the determination of ATR in plasma samples. The limit of detection was 0.04 ng mL−1 and the effective working range at relative standard deviations (RSD) of ≤5% was 0.1–10 ng mL−1. Mean analytical recovery of ATR from spiked plasma was 99.3 ± 2.8%. The precision of the assay was satisfactory; RSD were 2.7–4.6 and 3.3–5.7% for intra- and inter-assay precision, respectively. The reliability of the EIA was confirmed by HPLC. The EIA is convenient, and one can analyze ∼ 200 samples per working day, facilitating the processing of large-number of samples of ATR.
0	A novel and facile method has been developed for the fabrication of Pt–carbon fiber (Pt/CF) disk ultramicroelectrode (DUME). This method, which might be a simple and economical shortcut to get access to Pt/CF DUME, is based upon having metal Pt electroplated on CF DUME. In this paper, an electrode prepared through the new way was characterized by cyclic voltammetry and applied as probe for scanning electrochemical microscope.
0	With the catalysis of K2PdCl4 and H5PMo10V2O40 in CF3COOH, methane can be oxidized into CH3COOH and CF3COOCH3 using molecular oxygen as the oxidant at a low temperature. H5PMo10V2O40 is a reversible oxidant that allows to retain Pd(II) in CF3COOH and thus to complete a two-step catalytic cycle of oxidation of methane by molecular oxygen; in addition, it can catalytically oxidize methane into CH3COOH and CF3COOCH3.
0	This work deals with the effect of adding Na to bimetallic sol–gel derived alumina supported Co/Ni nanocatalysts in Fischer–Tropsch synthesis. The catalyst activity and selectivity changed with different levels of Na, and the catalyst with 2 % Na loading was selected as an optimal catalyst to compare with un-promoted Co/Ni/Al2O3 catalyst. Na reduced the methane selectivity by increasing the chain-growth probability (α-value) at 12 bar. The results of physico-chemical characterizations show that the Na promoter plays a significant role in the catalytic structure. Additionally, the kinetic behavior was considered in absence and presence of Na over CoNi/Al2O3 catalysts. We applied an enolic approach, which was developed based on the interaction between adsorption HCO and dissociated adsorption hydrogen, through the Langmuir–Hinshelwood–Hougen–Watson (LHHW) adsorption theory. Kinetic parameters, including the rate constant (k) and activation energy (E#N#                           a) of the catalysts, were also determined. The results show that, by adding Na, the activation energy (E#N#                           a) decreases and the reaction rate (–R#N#                           CO) increases.
1	One-step synthesis of dimethyl ether (DME) from H2/CO has been studied in a fixed bed reactor over hybrid catalyst CuOZnOAl2O3/γ-Al2O3-HZSM-5. The physicochemical properties of fresh and used catalysts were also studied by means of H2-TPR, XRD and N2O chemisorptions. The results showed that for deactivated catalysts by sintering, redox cycle was an effective method for in-situ regeneration. There were two different regeneration mechanisms according to various atmospheres: (i) For O2-syngas cycle, sintered Cu particles were re-dispersed and initial activity was restored mostly. The process was reversible, which was called reversible regeneration; (ii) for N2O (CO2)-syngas cycle, Cu particles could not be re-dispersed and catalytic activity was restored a little due to the regulation of surface state. On the other hand, this process could depress the deactivation velocity and was irreversible, which was called irreversible regeneration.
0	The effect of water and reductants (CO and H2) on the decomposition of NO#N#                  x#N#                 stored on BaO/Al2O3 at 300 °C has been investigated. Water eliminates the initial rapid total uptake of NO2 but has little effect on the subsequent formation of nitrates that is accompanied by evolution of NO. Water hinders liberation of NO2 and NO during temperature-programmed decomposition of stored NO#N#                  x#N#                . Both CO and H2 lower the temperatures required for decomposition through reduction of NO2 to NO and N2 thus restricting NO2 readsorption. The rate of reduction is lower with H2 than with CO.
0	Gallium-promoted sulfated zirconia (SZ) was confined inside pure-silica MCM-41 (abbreviated as SZGa/MCM-41), where the latter served as a host material. It was prepared by direct dispersion of metal sulfate in the as-synthesized MCM-41 materials, followed by thermal decomposition. The SZGa/MCM-41 catalysts were characterized by XRD, N2 adsorption, HRTEM, DRIFT, NH3-TPD, and TPR. The experimental results showed that the ordered porous host structure was still maintained in the catalyst. SZ was in meta-stable tetragonal phase and highly dispersed on the interior surface of MCM-41 even at a high loading of 50 wt%. Additionally, a small fraction of SZ nanoparticles on the external surface of MCM-41 was obtained. The catalytic activity of SZGa/MCM-41 was examined in n-butane isomerization. In comparison to SZ/MCM-41 without promoter, the catalytic activities of the Ga-promoted catalysts were greatly improved. The reason proposed for the higher activity of the Ga-promoted catalysts was that Ga enhances the oxidizing ability of the catalysts.
0	Cluster models are constructed for mono- and dinuclear Cr(II) sites and mononuclear Cr(III) sites on the Cr/SiO2 Phillips catalyst and used to compute d–d transition energies and intensities. Mononuclear pseudo-tetrahedral Cr(II) gives rise to two bands of electric-dipole-allowed d–d transitions, at 8,400 and 12,300 cm−1. This doublet is lowered in energy and intensity as the bond angle about chromium, ∠OCrO, opens up. The dinuclear site gives rise to bands at 5,200 and 10,300 cm−1, consistent with calculations for a mononuclear cluster of comparable value for ∠OCrO. A tri-coordinated Cr(III) cluster shows bands of comparable oscillator strengths at energies of 11,000, 16,000, 18,000–20,000 and 33,000 cm−1. The predicted bands correspond well with d–d bands in experimental diffuse reflectance spectra.
0	The effect of the presence of platinum on the surface of SO42−-ZrO2 was studied. The addition of platinum neither produces significant changes in the textural properties of SO42−-ZrO2 nor interferes in the process of crystalline structure formation. After calcining, the presence of platinum allows the retention of a higher sulfur concentration. When calcination takes place at 600°C, SO42−-ZrO2, with or without platinum, shows S6+ species on the surface, but only when platinum is present does a small amount of S0 species appear. At the same calcination temperature, platinum is found in the metallic state. Therefore, the S0 species could be associated with platinum by modifying its metallic properties.
0	In this paper, nanoporous nickel phosphate VSB-5 nanorods was synthesized with microwave irradiation and hydrothermal treatment and characterized by X-ray diffraction, FT-IR spectroscopy, Filed emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and EDS analysis. FESEM technique exhibited the presence of nickel phosphate nanorods morphology. The BET surface area, total pore volume and average pore diameter of synthesized nickel phosphate were obtained to be 102.5 m2 g−1, 0.14 cm3 g−1 and 3.6 nm, respectively. Carbon paste electrode (CPE) was modified by VSB-5 nanorods and then Ni2+ ions incorporated to this electrode to obtain Ni-VSB-5/CPE. The current intensity of glucose oxidation increases impressively on the surface of Ni-VSB-5/CPE and modified CPE can reduce the overvoltage of glucose oxidation in comparison with Ni-CPE. The values of electron transfer coefficient, diffusion coefficient and mean value of catalytic rate constant for glucose and redox sites of electrode were found to be 0.87, 6.18 × 10−4 cm2 s−1 and 3.06 × 105 cm3 mol−1 s−1, respectively. The good catalytic activity, high sensitivity, good selectivity and stability and ease of preparation rendered the Ni-VSB-5/CPE to be a capable electrode for glucose electro-oxidation.
0	Nanoporous 7930 Vycor silica tubes with Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) deposited arachidic acid salts undergo oxidative plasma treatment to yield fully inorganic asymmetric membranes. Membranes from precursors with different numbers of LB layers are examined by differential, integral and relative permeability methods for the determination of the structural characteristics of the separating top layer. The membrane top layer is found to be dominated by medium size micropores, while a small population of defective surface sites (partially covered original pores) is also present. The gas separation potential of inorganic asymmetric membranes from ceramic oxide-LB film composites is discussed.
1	The delay time dependence of photoelectron spectra and state populations of three-level ladder K2 molecule is investigated by pump-probe pulses via time-dependent wave packet approach. The periodical motion of the wave packet with oscillating period 500 fs results in the periodical variation of photoelectron spectra. The photoelectron spectra show Autler-Townes double splitting at zero delay time, and no splitting at positive delay time. The periodical change of state populations with delay time can be ascribed to the coupling effect between the two pulses. It is found that the selectivity of the state populations may be attained by regulating the delay time. The results can provide some important basis for realizing the optical control of molecules experimentally.
0	In the present work, the decorated purified raw multi-walled carbon nanotubes (R-MWCNTs) were obtained by chemical modification (CM) by treatment with concentrated sulfuric acid and concentrated nitric acid mixture with a certain volume ratio of 1: 3. The R-MWCNTs and CM-MWCNTs samples were investigated by X-ray Diffraction (XRD) analysis and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). The prepared MWCNTs were homogeneously dispersed in water using a commercial surfactant (Polyvinyl pyrrolidone, (PVP)) and ultra-sonication. The dispersion of MWCNTs was obtained by UV-Vis analysis. The results show that chemical modification purified MWCNTs and more effective functional groups were attached on the surface of MWCNTs. Meanwhile, R-MWCNTs and CM-MWCNTs were uniformly distributed in aqueous PVP solution and the dispersion of CM-MWCNTs in water was better.
0	Halide-doped n-type samples of the Bi2Te2.7Se0.3 solid solution have been prepared by hot-pressing melt-spun powders. The morphology of the powders and fracture surfaces of the hot-pressed samples have been examined by scanning electron microscopy, and the electrical conductivity, Seebeck coefficient, and thermal conductivity of the samples have been measured at room temperature and in the range 100–700 K. The thermoelectric properties of the samples have been compared to those of a sample prepared by extruding a mechanically ground ingot. The highest thermoelectric figure of merit of the materials obtained in this study is ZT ≃ 0.9.
0	This work concerns the preparation of novel optically active nanocomposite materials derived from Cloisite Na+ clay, which has been functionalized by protonated l-methionine amino acid as a swelling agent for sufficient compatibilization with the poly(amide-imide) (PAI) matrix. The polymer chains were formed from the polycondensation reaction of N,N′-(pyromellitoyl)-bis-phenylalanine diacid chloride with 4,4′-diaminodiphenylether. Interaction between the two phases was established by modifying the PAI chains with amine end groups and free acid groups of the organoclay (OC). The effect of OC dispersion and the interaction between OC and PAI chains on the properties of resulting bionanocomposite material was studied using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy and thermogravimetric analysis techniques. The XRD pattern and morphological investigation revealed the formation of intercalated and exfoliated OC platelets in the matrix. Because of the existence of naturally occurring amino acids as biological chiral resources, it is predictable that these materials may be potentially biodegradable and biocompatible.
0	The inhibition effect of chromate (CrO42−) and molybdate (MoO42−) anions on the pitting corrosion of 16Mn carbon steel in 0.1 M NaCl containing bicarbonate solution was studied based on electrochemical noise analysis (ENA) and the potentiodynamic polarization method. The experimental results indicated that, once the pits occur on the surface of the carbon steel after 4–6 h of immersion, increasing the concentration of CrO42− and MoO42− ions accelerate the repassivation process, and attenuate the duration and the nucleation rate of metastable pits. Further analysis demonstrated that noise resistance Rn might not be suitable for the evaluation of the inhibition efficiency of CrO42− and MoO42− anions on pitting corrosion in the present system. However, the transient charge qpit, which is an integral of all current transients during a certain period, can characterize the inhibition performance on pitting corrosion. A new definition of inhibition efficiency based on qpit is given.
1	A systematic study of oxidation of isobutanol to isobutyric acid over a nickel oxide anode was carried out in a flow cell with well defined geometry. Various procedures for the activation of the anode were studied regarding their effect on the current efficiency and anode life. An attempt was made to optimize the other relevant operating parameters.
1	A new polypyridyl ligand, MCP {MCP = 2-(3-chlorophenyl)imidazo[4,5-f]1,10-phenanthroline} and its ruthenium(II) complex, [Ru(bpy)2(MCP)](ClO4)2· 0.5MeCN (bpy = 2,2′-bipyridine), have been synthesized and characterized. The structure of the complex was determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction techniques. The MCP ligand is essentially planar and the stacking interactions between the ligands were observed in the crystal. [Ru(bpy)2(MCP)]2+ can strongly bind to Calf thymus DNA through intercalation of MCP ligand. The Cl substitute group has no significant effect on the spectral properties and DNA-binding behaviour of the complex.
0	Reactions of bis(1-oxopyridine-2-thione) NiII or CuII with 2,2′-bipyridine (bipy) or 1,10-phenanthroline (phen) yield complexes of stoichiometry: Ni(C5H4NOS)2L {L = bipy, two isomers: (1) and (2), L = phen, one isomer (3)} and Cu(C5H4NOS)2(phen)·0.75CHCl3(4). The spectroscopy (i.r., u.v.-vis., e.s.r.) and magnetism studies of the above complexes are described. On the basis of conductivity, the CuII-phen complex has been formulated as [Cu(C5H4NOS)(phen)2][Cu(C5H4NOS)3]·1.5CHCl3(4). The vis. absorption spectra support similar octahedral structures for the minor bipy isomer (2) and for the NiII-phen complex [(3)], whereas the major isomer [(1)] has a different structure. The e.s.r. spectrum of the CuII-phen complex (4) is commensurate with an elongated octahedral structure. New methods for the preparation and spectroscopy of M(C5H4NOS)2 (M = Mn, Ni, Cu or Zn) compounds have been investigated.
1	Supramolecular complexes of [60]- and [70]fullerenes with various meso-tetraphenylporphyrins in toluene solutions have been studied by electronic absorption spectroscopy. Charge transfer (CT) absorption bands are observed in the visible region. Vertical ionization potentials (I D V) of the meso-tetraphenylporphyrins are reported from a study of EDA interaction of these porphyrins with a number of electron acceptors like o-chloranil, p-chloranil, 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyanobenzoquinone (DDQ) and vitamin K. The dependence of the CT transition energy on the donor ionization potential has been utilized to estimate the vertical electron affinities (E A V) of [60]- and [70]fullerenes in solution. The value of E A V for [60]fullerene is found to be 0.10 eV lower in magnitude than that of [70]fullerene. We have extracted degrees of CT, and oscillator and transition dipole strengths of the fullerenes/meso-tetraphenylporphyrins complexes. The experimental results show that the CT complexes studied here have a neutral character in their ground states. Electronic coupling elements have been determined for fullerene/meso-tetraphenylporphyrin complexes. Values of the solvent reorganization energy indicate that the electron transfer process takes place at a faster rate in the case of [70]fullerene/meso-tetraphenylporphyrin complexes.
0	Single ion activities in aqueous H2SO4 have been calculated from the mean ionic activity coefficients of H2SO4, the solubilities of PbSO4 and the degrees of the second dissociation of H2SO4 in these solutions by employing a new extra-thermodynamic assumption. The hydrogen ion activities thus obtained are compared with the corresponding acidity function values based on different classes of acid-base indicators.
1	A study was carried out on the effect of a modifying additive on the kinetics of the dehydration of phosphoric gypsum. The dehydration of gypsum materials occurs through a mechanism of continuous localization in the bulk of the crystal. The modification of phosphoric gypsum leads to a considerable decrease in the activation energy of dehydration.
1	Flash photolysis has been used to measure triplet-triplet (T-T) absorption spectra of Pd phthalocyanine, Zn-l,2-naphthalocyanine, Pd-tetra-6-tert-butyl-2,3-naphthalocyanine, and Zn-tetra-2,3-benzo[g]quinoxalinoporphyrazine. On the basis of the results obtained in this work, together with literature data, an analysis has been made of the influence of annelation in a series of metallocomplexes of tetraazaporphin and the influence of aza-substitution in tetraarenoporphins on the T-T-absorption spectra.
0	Electrochemical performance of the pre-lithiated graphite and the as-assembled lithium-ion capacitors (LICs) were investigated within the Li/graphite two-electrode cell and activated carbon (AC)/graphite two-electrode cell, respectively. The morphologies of the electrodes were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The Li intercalation of Li/graphite two-electrode cell was performed using short circuiting and galvanostatic charging techniques. The Li pre-doping process was characterized by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The cycle performance of the LICs were investigated at the rates of 1–20 C between the cut-off voltage at 2 to 4 V. The results demonstrated that the LIC cells with 8 h pre-doping time have the best cycle performance at the high rate of 10 C. Li pre-doping methodology plays a crucial role in the electrochemical performance of the graphite electrode and the as-assembled LICs.
0	The effects of N2 partial pressure in the unbalanced magnetron sputtering process on the microstructure, hardness, and thermal stability of the CrZrSiN nanocomposite coating were investigated. A typical nanocomposite structure, composed of a crystalline phase and an amorphous phase was obtained and the distribution of these phases changed with increasing N2 partial pressure. The N1s spectra revealed the presence of two-peak characteristic of nitrogen in the CrZrN and SiN x phases, and the ratio of the peak’s SiN x to CrZrN intensity increased with increasing N2 partial pressure, indicating an increase in the amorphous phase in the nanocomposite microstructure. As N2 partial pressure increased, the CrZrSiN coating hardness decreased from 38 to 30 GPa due to the increasing amount of the SiN x amorphous phase. After the thermal stability test, the hardness values of the CrZrSiN coatings were maintained at approximately 30 GPa up to 800°C, but the hardness decreased rapidly to 18 GPa after annealing at 900°C. This drastic change of hardness over 900C was due to the formation of a Cr2O3 phase in the CrZrSiN coating.
0	A novel method is proposed for preparing biocompatible aqueous CeO2 sols, which allows purposefully adjusting particle sizes and biochemical properties of nanocrystalline ceria (NC). The usefulness of this method for preparing aqueous sols of Ce1 − x Gd x O2 − x/2 solid solutions is demonstrated. Nanocrystalline ceria has been demonstrated to have a size-dependent activity in hydroxyl radical inactivation and in protecting mouse fibroblast cells (L929) from oxidative stress induced by hydrogen peroxide administration.
0	Complexes of copper(II), nickel(II), and cobalt(II) chlorides and bromides with 2-phenyl-4-(piperidyl-1)-anthra[1,2-b]pyridine-7,12-dione (L1) and 2-[phenyl-4-(octylamino)-anthra[1,2-b]pyridine-7,12-dione (L2) were synthesized from neutral and acidic media. The molecular and crystal structure of 2-phenyl-4-(piperidyl-1)-anthra[1,2-b]pyridine-7,12-dionium hexabromodicuprate(II) (HL1)2[Cu2Br6] was determined by X-ray diffraction analysis.

1	The oxidation of n-hexane, cyclohexane, cumene (isopropylbenzene), and cyclohexene in a barrier discharge reactor under conditions ensuring effective product transport out of the discharge zone was studied. It was shown that hydrocarbon oxidation reactions can be carried out in barrier discharge plasma reactors with a fairly high selectivity. The oxidation of n-hexane, cyclohexane, and cumene primarily yields the hydroxy and carbonyl compounds alcohols, aldehydes and ketones. The major product of cyclohexene oxidation is epoxycyclohexane (~62 wt %).
0	The solution of dislocation equation is explored by extracting the core component from the total displacement field. The core component, which describes the core structure of dislocation, can be given by a set of localized functions which are orthogonal each other. The displacement field with both the edge and screw components are studied simultaneously by introducing an intrinsic frame which is given by directions parallel and perpendicular to the Burger’s vector. From application to the dislocations in the materials YCu, it is found that the method is efficient in solving the dislocation equation in particular for the dislocation with a complex core.
0	We study both theoretically and experimentally the photon-in and photon-out spectra of CeO 2 , which are caused by the Ce 2p to Ce 5d excitation followed by the three different de-excitation channels: (i) Ce 3d to Ce 2p (denoted by 3d-RXES), (ii) O 2p to Ce 2p (v-RXES), and (iii) Ce 5d to Ce 2p (RIXS). In 3d- and v-RXES, the 5d electron plays a role of a spectator, but in RIXS it is a participator. By extending our single impurity Anderson model (SIAM), which was used recently for our calculations of v- and 3d-RXES spectra of CeO 2 , we study the polarization dependence in the spectator and participator spectra, and we perform more detailed calculations for 3d- and v-RXES spectral features, as well as new calculations for the RIXS spectrum with charge transfer excitations. The polarization dependence is different for the spectator and participator spectra; we have no polarization correlation between the incident and emitted photons for the spectator spectra but a strong polarization correlation for the participator spectrum. The theoretical calculations predict that the charge transfer excitations in RIXS occur in the transfer-energy range overlapped with v-RXES, but the RIXS and v-RXES spectra can be discriminated by taking advantage of the different polarization dependence. The overlapped RIXS and v-RXES spectra are observed successfully by our experiments and well reproduced by our SIAM calculations. Copyright EDP Sciences, SIF, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012
0	In the present paper, the effect of non-polar longitudinal optical phonons on domain wall resistance has been studied using the semiclassical approach. The analysis has been based on the Boltzmann transport equation, within the relaxation time approximation. We have determined the magnetoresistance of domain wall in nanowires based on diluted magnetic semiconductors. The modulation of the exchange and the impurity interactions by lattice vibrations, and the hole–phonon interaction are considered. The results indicate that the scattering role of phonons becomes significant by increasing temperature, which leads to the resistivity enhancement. It is also found that the magnetic impurities play an impressive role in enhancing the contribution of the domain wall in the resistance. In providing room temperature spintronics devices, understanding the effects of phonons and magnetic impurities on the domain wall resistance is crucial.
0	According to general formula MgB2−xSiCx (x = 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2), MgB2 and SiC-doped bulk superconduc- tors were prepared by the standard ceramic processing. The mixtures of the corresponding powders were sintered at 750 °C for 0.5 h under pressure of 8 bar Argon. X-ray dif- fraction patterns show that all the samples have MgB2 as the main phase with a very small amount of MgO; further, with SiC-doped, the presence of Mg2Si is also noted. The magnetization-temperature measurements showed a transi- tion temperature of 37.5 K for the undoped sample which indicates the typical transition temperature of MgB2. When the content of SiC increased in the sample, the transition temperatures decreased to the lower temperatures system- atically. The M-H loops measured using a VSM showed very large magnetization value at low temperature for SiC doped samples. The largest M-H loops were taken from the sample contains 5% SiC. The critical current density of samples calculated from M-H loops indicated a value of around 4 × 10 5 A/cm 2 , which is in good agreement with the literature.
0	Optical lattices of excitons in periodic systems of InGaN quantum wells with GaN barriers are designed, implemented, and investigated. Due to the collective interaction of quasi-two-dimensional excitons with light and a fairly high binding energy of excitons in GaN, optical Bragg reflection at room temperature is significantly enhanced. To increase the resonance optical response of the system, new structures with two quantum wells in a periodic supercell are designed and implemented. Resonance reflection of 40% at room temperatures for structures with 60 periods is demonstrated.
1	The kinetics of fast processes induced by an ultrashort laser pulse is considered. The reliefs remaining after the action of a series of ultrashort laser pulses {S. A. Akhmanov, V. I. Emelyanov, N. I. Koroteev, et al., Usp. Fiz. Nauk 147, 675 (1985) [Sov. Phys. Usp. 28, 1084 (1985)]; F. Costache, S. Kouteva-Arguirova, and J. Reif, Appl. Phys. A 79, 1429 (2004)} have been studied. A new mechanism of perturbing the surface of the initially ideal crystal face is described. First, the formation of a relief is induced by a single pulse. Second, the relief scale along the target surface is about the heating depth d T ∼ 10–100 nm rather than the pump-pulse wavelength λpump ∼ 1 μm. Third, the formation of the relief is not attributed to the modulation of the electromagnetic field near the surface due to the interference of the incident light wave with the electromagnetic surface waves on the initial perturbations of the boundary. These three conditions are satisfied for a known instability induced by the interference of the incident and surface waves (see the works cited above [1]). In our case, the nanorelief is formed due to the deformation of the spalled layer by cavitation bubbles owing to the inhomogeneity of the drag force in the target plane. Cavitation is caused by the tension of the substance in the process of the expansion of a heated target. It is similar to the known phenomenon of the cavitation “spallation” in a liquid despite the large difference between the space-time scales of the usual spallation facility and the femtosecond heating. Owing to this difference, usual cavitation does not leave any morphological trace on the outer free surface of the spalled layer.
0	Electron-microscopic examinations of the evolution of the defect substructure and phase composition have been carried out for quenched 60GS2 carbon steel subjected to multiple cycles of fatigue loading. The mechanisms by which the fatigue durability of the steel processed at an intermediate stage of loading by alternating electric current is increased have been investigated.

0	Films of the Co50Pt50, Co50Pd50, and Co50Pt50 − xPdx alloys (where x = 1–10 at %) have been prepared. The processes of atomic ordering and its influence on the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy and the coercive force in these films have been investigated. The dependence of the coercive force on the film thickness has been analyzed. It has been shown that thin films of ordered alloys become magnetically uniaxial with the easy axis normal to their plane and can be used for magnetic and thermomagnetic recording and storage of information.
1	The two-dimensional (2D) Heisenberg model with anisotropic exchange (Δ = 1−J x /J z ) and S=1/2 is investigated by the quantum Monte Carlo method. The energy, susceptibility, specific heat, spin-spin correlation functions, and correlation radius are calculated. The sublattice magnetization (σ) and the Neel temperature of the anisotropic antiferromagnet are logarithmic functions of the exchange anisotropy: 1/σ+1+0.13(1)ln(1/Δ). Crossover of the static magnetic structural factor as a function of temperature from power-law to exponential occurs for T c /J≈0.4. The correlation radius can be approximated by 1/ξ=2.05T1.0(6)/exp(1.0(4)/T). For La2CuO4 the sublattice magnetization is calculated as σ=0.45, the exchange is J=(1125–1305) K; for Er2CuO4J∼625 K and the exchange anisotropy Δ∼0.003. The temperature dependence of the static structural magnetic factor and the correlation radius above the Neel temperature in these compounds can be explained by the formation of topological excitations (spinons).
0	The penetration of quantum and classical charged particles through porous films is investigated. The passage of quantum particles is analyzed by numerically solving the Schrodinger equation. The force of polarization acting on a charge is calculated by means of classical electrodynamics. The possibility of perforating thin films is analyzed.
0	We have experimentally and theoretically studied IR-active optical phonons, which are spatially confined in the volume of semiconducting CdS nanocrystals of various shapes synthesized in a dielectric matrix (porous aluminum oxide). Within an approach admitting the mixing of all expected types of vibrations, the complete sets of phonon modes are determined for a spherical quantum dot (QD) and a cylindrical quantum wire (QW) in this matrix. Based on these results, the polarizability spectra of QDs and QWs, as well as the effective dielectric function of a composite material containing such nanoparticles, are calculated for the far-IR wavelength range. It is established that the spectrum of the dielectric function exhibits specific features in the region between the transverse and longitudinal optical phonon frequencies of the massive semiconductor material. These features explain the rather unusual structure of the IR spectra of the composite samples studied.
0	Generalized Ginzburg-Landau functionals describing transitions between bcc, fcc, and hcp structures are studied using four weakly nonuniform transformation parameters: three tensile strains along the principal crystallographic axes and a “phonon” parameter describing relative slip of close-packed planes. Several versions of transformation paths indicated for each of the three transformations considered, which appear to be the most realistic; explicit expressions for atomic displacements are given for each of these paths. It is shown that the gradient terms in these functionals can be explicitly expressed in terms of the dynamic matrix of the crystal on a transformation path; these dynamic matrices can be determined using interpolations of experimental data on phonon spectra between the initial and final phases. The results are used for estimating the characteristics of interphase boundaries between ferrite and cementite in steels. It is found that the width of such interfaces considerably exceeds the interatomic distance, while the estimated values of the gradient terms are in reasonable agreement with the available experimental data.
1	The total bremsstrahlung spectra for electrons colliding with atoms have been calculated for krypton atoms in a photon energy range from 10 eV to 25 keV and for lanthanum atoms in the vicinity of the 4d shell ionization energy. The generalized atomic polarizabilities were calculated using a simple semiclassical local energy density approximation and experimental data on the photon absorption. The results are compared to those obtained using the distorted partial wave approximation for Kr and to the experimental data available for La.
